Abstract = {This paper argues that transitions research more broadly needs to take
   more account of justice in its analysis. This paper draws primarily from
   environmental and energy justice literature to engage with the concept
   of justice in transitions research, as it seeks justice for people,
   communities, and the non-human environment from negative environmental
   impacts. This is achieved through different forms of justice:
   distributive, procedural, and recognition. Our paper concludes with
   reflections upon the application of a justice approach to sustainability
   transitions research and offer insights into a potentially new research
   agenda.},

Title = {Applying energy justice into the energy transition},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {156},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Energy justice has become a leading interdisciplinary energy research
   topic over the last decade. There has been a realisation that the energy
   sector was missing an overall raison d'e<SIC>tre, and that is to have
   justice permeating throughout the sector. This expert insight opens the
   door to a more practical element that is needed within this energy
   justice research. It focuses on how energy justice can be applied and
   implemented into the energy transition. All energy researchers can
   connect with the topic of justice, and as such, it should be the same
   when thinking of the energy sector. Normatively all researchers and
   practitioners should have a common goal and vision of how the energy
   sector should develop over the coming decades. This common goal and
   vision is not just brought on due to technological change that has
   created the energy transition but also the provision of a more fair,
   equal, equitable and inclusive transition (i.e., justice). National
   legal systems define what this justice will be and these institutions
   will create what in essence are the `rules of the game' for the energy
   sector. This expert insight explores how these institutions act, enforce
   and create those rules of the game when they resolve disputes that
   arise. In solving these disputes between different parties, law creates
   the rules of the game as they interpret how law is applied in practice
   to different stakeholders. The legal system allocates different
   stakeholders rights and obligations, and ultimately decides on a
   hierarchy of these rights. This expert insight provides a brief overview
   of analysis from 100 legal cases from across the world and demonstrates
   which forms of justice and human rights are being implemented in the
   energy transition today. This represents a starting point, and the aim
   is that society needs to go far beyond this in order to ensure we meet
   in an accelerated way our future climate goals and ambitions for a
   sustainable world.},

Title = {Energy justice and sustainability transitions in Mozambique},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {645-655},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper advances the debate on energy justice by opening up a
   dialogue with postcolonial critiques of development. There is an
   imperative to develop energy justice theory fit to address the complex
   demands of a global energy transitions in poorer countries of the Global
   South. Delivering transformative change in contexts where energy systems
   are underdeveloped requires assessing energy justice principles from
   multiple situated perspectives, adjusted to the conditions that shape
   the possibilities for action. However, current theorizations of energy
   justice tend to build upon universalist notions of justice within a
   western tradition of thought which may not be entirely appropriate to
   deliver policy in postcolonial contexts.
   This paper offers a situated, particularistic analysis of energy
   transitions in Mozambique - a country which faces massive energy access
   challenges - to open a dialogue between theories of energy justice and
   postcolonial critiques. The paper focuses on three aspects of the energy
   transition occurring in Mozambique: the logics and impacts of off-grid
   innovation, the situated transformations occurring in the electricity
   network, and how transitions in energy fuels shape household experiences
   of energy access. The conclusion proposes two recommendations as key
   agendas for future research. The first is a methodological need for
   research methods to examine energy justice challenges from within
   specific, situated understandings of energy delivery. The second entails
   a call for emancipatory notions of energy justice that integrate
   concepts such as energy sovereignty at their core to emphasise the
   dimension of self-determination as a complementary aspect of energy
   justice.},

Abstract = {Just transition is a new framework of analysis that brings together

   originally coined as a term that was designed to link the promotion of
   clean technology with the assurance of green jobs. The Paris climate

   is needed to avert disastrous consequences. In response, climate, energy
   and environmental justice scholarships must unite in assessing where

Title = {The Energy Futures Lab: A case study of justice in energy transitions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {290-301},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While the concept of `just transitions' has become more and more
   prominent in academic and popular discussions of sustainability
   transition, these conceptions are often framed in purely economic terms,
   and focus on the economic impact on communities, regions, and
   nation-states. We argue that a broader conception of justice in
   transitions, and in particular energy transitions, is required.
   Questions such as who will win and who will lose as society transitions
   to more sustainable future, who decides what the transition will look
   like, how are those historically excluded from decision making
   recognized, and how are the interests of non-humans and future
   generations included are important to answer in order to ensure that
   concepts of justice are included in transitions processes. Answering
   these questions is critical in ``ensuring that system transitions are
   not only more sustainable, but also more just{''} (Williams and Doyon,
   2019, p. 144). In this paper, we apply the justice and system transition
   framework (Williams and Doyon, 2019) to the Energy Futures Lab (EFL). We
   find that while the EFL has made great strides towards justice in
   transition, the EFL is also a demonstration of the challenges of
   incorporating justice such as addressing issues of power dynamics and
   conceptions of diversity and inclusion. We also find that the justice
   and system transitions framework proves to be a valuable tool in
   assessing justice in transitions projects. Going beyond the common `just
   transition' approach that focuses on distributive justice gives a richer
   conception of justice and ensures that procedural and recognition
   approaches are included.},

   key themes in interdisciplinary research},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},

Volume = {233},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {With the dual challenges of reducing emissions from fossil fuels and
   providing access to clean and affordable energy, there is an imperative
   for a transition to a low carbon energy system. The transition must take
   into consideration questions of energy justice to ensure that policies,
   plans and programmes guarantee fair and equitable access to resources
   and technologies. An energy justice framework is outlined to account for
   distributional, procedural and recognition inequalities, as well as
   emerging themes such as cosmopolitan and non Western understandings of
   justice, in decision-making relating to energy systems. The spectrum of
   research offers critical perspectives on the energy transition as well
   as tools for decision-making and policy processes. Quantitative,
   qualitative and mixed methods all contribute to our understanding of the
   problems and the success of responses. The studies presented in this
   special issue illustrate that the field of energy justice is a rapidly
   growing arena. There is constant innovation taking place in enabling the
   transition with new structures, processes and metrics being introduced
   to guide decision-making and a more holistic view of the community
   emerging where acceptance, mobilisation and empowerment are opening
   possibilities for a just transition to a low carbon energy system. The
   importance of introducing the interdisciplinary approach between social
   sciences and natural sciences as well engineering implementation
   supported by scientific data and experiments shall be emphasized in
   future studies.},

Title = {`Successful' low-carbon energy transitions at the community level? An
   energy justice perspective},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {292-303},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to critically analyse so-called `successful'
   low-carbon energy transitions under the energy justice magnifying glass.
   We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as
   successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samso (Denmark)
   and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and
   causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the
   transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and
   process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We
   identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas:
   consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision making and
   outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were
   triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and
   highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas.
   Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the
   location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven
   by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes,
   evidence of perceived procedural Justice was found in both cases. With
   regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of
   the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point
   of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more
   positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including
   the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative
   analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations,
   we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in
   both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived
   legitimacy of outcomes.},

Abstract = {The burgeoning energy justice scholarship highlights the importance of
   justice and equity concerns in the context of global decarbonization and
   the transition to a green economy. This paper seeks to extend current
   conceptualizations of energy justice across entire energy lifecycles,
   from extraction to final use, to offer an analytically richer and more
   accurate picture of the (in)justice impacts of energy policy decisions.
   We identify two key areas that require greater attention and scrutiny in
   order to enact energy justice within a more democratized energy system.
   First, we call for greater recognition of the politics, power dynamics
   and political economy of socio-technical energy transitions. We use the
   example of the fossil fuel divestment movement as a way to shift energy
   justice policy attention upstream to focus on the under-researched
   injustices relating to supply-side climate policy analysis and
   decisions. Second, the idea of a ``just transition{''} and the
   distributional impacts on ``and the role of labor in low-carbon
   transitions must be addressed more systematically. This focus produces a
   more directly political and politicizing framing of energy (in)justice
   and a just energy transition.},

Abstract = {The U.S. is experiencing unprecedented movement away from coal and, to a
   lesser degree, oil. Burdened low-income communities and people of color
   could experience health benefits from reductions in air and water
   pollution, yet these same groups could suffer harm if transitions lack
   broad public input or if policies prioritize elite or corporate
   interests. This paper highlights how U.S. energy transitions build from,
   and contribute to, environmental injustices. Energy justice requires not
   only ending disproportionate harm, it also entails involvement in the
   design of solutions and fair distribution of benefits, such as green
   jobs and clean air. To what extent does the confluence of state, civic,
   and market processes assure just transitions to clean, low-carbon energy
   production involving equitable distribution of costs, benefits, and
   decision-making power? To explore this question we assess trends with
   (1) fossil fuel divestment; (2) carbon taxes and social cost of carbon
   measurements; (3) cap-and-trade; (4) renewable energy; and (5) energy
   efficiency. Current research demonstrates opportunities and pitfalls in
   each area with mixed or partial energy justice consequences, leading to
   our call for greater attention to the specifics of distributive justice,
   procedural justice, and recognition justice in research, policy, and
   action. Illustrative energy transition case studies suggest the
   feasibility and benefit of empowering approaches, but also indicate
   there can be conflict between green and just, as evident though stark
   inequities in clean energy initiatives. To identify positive pathways
   forward, we compile priorities for an energy justice research agenda
   based on interactive and participatory practices aligning advocacy,
   activism, and academics.},

Title = {Humanizing sociotechnical transitions through energy justice: An ethical
   framework for global transformative change},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {66-74},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Poverty, climate change and energy security demand awareness about the
   interlinkages between energy systems and social justice. Amidst these
   challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where
   all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable
   energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social
   and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and
   interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown.
   However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is
   explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the
   development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an
   obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions
   frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so
   through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical
   systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche,
   regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within
   the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy
   justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause
   injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and
   potential resolve them.},

Abstract = {Sustainable energy transitions necessarily comprise both socio-technical
   aspects as well as important implications for social justice. However,
   in existing scholarship, these are mainly treated as distinct phenomena.
   The purpose of this paper is to outline a comprehensive approach that
   pulls together critical aspects of both socio-technical development and
   energy justice in understanding sustainable transitions. Drawing on the
   strengths of both sets of literature, we argue that a comprehensive
   approach requires analyses to account for the co-evolution of
   institutional change, material change and relational change, with a
   cross-cutting concern for multiple spatialities and normative
   implications. We then illustrate this approach through three brief case
   studies of multi-scalar solar uptake in Portugal, bringing out how
   justice considerations are intricately involved in the practices and
   politics of these concrete, broadly representative instances of
   sustainable energy transitions.},

Title = {The relationship between justice and acceptance of energy transition
   costs in the UK},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {222},
Pages = {451-459},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Relatively little energy research has attended to justice
   considerations. The limited energy justice inquiry that exists focuses
   on justice in relation to impacts of energy production, consumption, and
   policies that either exacerbate or seek to mitigate distributive and
   procedural concerns. Programmes aimed at facilitating the so-called
   `energy transition' have strong implications for energy justice. For
   example, efforts to reduce energy consumption and/or carbon emissions,
   policies to increase energy security, and programmes to increase energy
   access and affordability all address distributive concerns.
   Nevertheless, the costs associated with meeting such goals and running
   such programmes also have justice implications and should be viewed
   alongside the other aforementioned nonnative issues as an aspect of
   energy justice. Here, we examine public perceptions of who should fund
   programmes designed to ease the transition to a more sustainable and
   equitable energy system, finding most responsibility assigned to energy
   companies, and beliefs about procedural justice meaningfully shaping
   thoughts on who should pay. Our UK-based mixed methods inquiry reveals
   that whilst our respondents (survey) and participants (focus groups)
   accept some personal costs directed towards governmental programmes that
   could reduce energy injustices, acceptance is dependent on several
   factors, including perceived importance of distributive justice and
   whether the energy system exhibits procedural justice. The influence of
   normative factors on cost acceptance has implications for feasibility of
   polices to promote energy justice. We conducted a survey (N = 3,150),
   followed by five focus groups (N = 6-9 each) throughout Great Britain
   with survey respondents to explore further their answers and explain
   some of our quantitative findings. We conclude this paper with tangible
   policy recommendations for government, such as the amount (cost) and
   types of environmental and social levies that are viable, based on their
   public acceptance, and suggestions for other approaches to funding
   energy transitions, so as not to exceed the limits of public acceptance.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy has made significant inroads in addressing growing
   energy demands on the African continent. However, progress towards SDG 7
   is still limited and difficult to trace. Furthermore, the
   results-oriented rationale of the SDGs means that both policy change and
   the dimension of environmental justice are not covered properly. We
   argue that the energy justice concept may provide a powerful tool to
   offset looming trade-offs and enhance the co-benefits of SDG 7 within
   broader transition endeavours. In doing so, we assess African energy
   transition processes based on a comparative mapping of African renewable
   energy policies in 34 countries. We investigate the scope of policy
   frameworks in order to analyse their contribution to greater energy
   justice along different justice dimensions. We then identify four
   transition scenarios, which reflect the challenges of integrating the
   justice dimension into renewable energy policies. In comparing these
   scenarios, we argue that SDG 7 tracking needs to consider the justice
   dimension to arrive at a more holistic implementation that is in line
   with socio-ecological justice and takes account of people's energy
   needs.},

Abstract = {Just transition is gaining increasing attention. The need to consider
   social justice in sustainability transitions is finally being
   acknowledged. Research on this issue has, to date, mainly concentrated
   on energy systems. In this paper, we examine how the elaboration of
   dietary transition widens the spectrum of justice questions in
   sustainability transitions research. We explicate the arising normative
   questions along the dimensions of distributive, procedural and
   recognitive justice; widening the considerations further to restorative
   and cosmopolitan justice. Dietary transition widens the justice
   considerations to basic needs, food security and nutrition. By doing so,
   it evokes socio-cultural tensions that require recognition and
   procedural solutions. The uneven distribution of capacities to innovate
   and adapt require scrutiny from the just transition scholarship.
   Likewise, the recognition of non-human animals and integrity of
   agro-ecological systems. The relational three-dimensional understanding
   of justice can advance inter- and transdisciplinary research across
   various systems.},

Title = {Energy transitions from the cradle to the grave: A meta-theoretical
   framework integrating responsible innovation, social practices, and
   energy justice},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An almost inexhaustible number of conceptual approaches has arisen in
   the past few decades to seek to explain the interlinked phenomena of
   energy transitions, low-carbon transitions, or sociotechnical change.
   With an eye for theoretical synthesis, this study asks: What do three
   particular epistemic communities-those concerning innovation, practices,
   and justice-say about energy transitions? What does this literature
   reveal about the injustices and inequalities of energy transitions?
   Finally, what can we learn by integrating aspects of this literature?
   The study answers these questions by drawing from responsible research
   and innovation, social practice theory, and energy justice approaches.
   Essentially the first is about the design of technology, the second how
   it is used, the third the broader societal and global implications.
   Taken together, the study offers an integrative framework capable of
   analyzing transitions from their ``cradle{''} of design to their
   ``life{''} of use to their ``grave{''} of aftereffects. It explores the
   extent to which the three perspectives can be integrated into a
   meta-theoretical framework. This integrative framework is then applied
   to four diverse case studies: French nuclear power, Greek wind energy,
   Papua New Guinean solar energy, and Estonian oil shale.},

Title = {Practices and imaginations of energy justice in transition. A case study
   of the Noordoostpolder, the Netherlands},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {607-614},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Renewable energy technologies are often idealized as environmentally
   innocent alternatives to fossil fuels. Fossil fuel extraction is often
   considered as `unjust' and renewable energy as the `just' alternative.
   At the same time renewable energy projects, such as wind parks, are
   often resisted because of the uneven impacts of its infrastructure. This
   paper analyses such ambiguous meanings of energy justice (social justice
   issues related to energy) along the lines of its three tenets:
   distributional, procedural and recognition justice, aiming to understand
   how energy justice is constructed from below. It does so on the basis of
   a case study in the Noordoostpolder (the Netherlands) where plans for
   extracting shale gas went together with both large-scale and small-scale
   renewable energy practices. The paper analyses how energy justice is
   `made' by how people resist shale gas and engage in `renewable energy
   practices' and as such produce new imaginations and normativities of
   energy justice. Such an ethnographic approach helps to understand energy
   justice as a process of co-construction of activists, policy makers and
   scholars and as such responds to recent calls for a human-centred
   approach to the study of energy transitions. The paper is based on two
   and a half years of ethnographic fieldwork in the Noordoostpolder.},

Title = {An Ecohealth approach to energy justice: Evidence from Malawi?s energy
   transition from biomass to electrification},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Decarbonisation is essential to limiting the electricity sector's
   contributions to CO2 emissions. Simultaneously, there is recognition of
   the need to increase electricity access in many parts of sub-Saharan
   Africa, such as in Malawi, with renewable energies suggested as capable
   of meeting these needs. However, the drive for low carbon
   electrification, especially in settings where biomass use for cooking is
   widespread, may act as a driver of new and intersecting injustices. The
   energy justice framework is well posited to recognise injustices which
   emerge across energy supply chains, though existing analysis has
   typically focused on single energy systems. In order to capture
   injustices emerging in settings of dual biomass use and hydroelectricity
   generation, it is necessary to consider how energy systems impact on
   both human health (e.g. air pollution from biomass burning) and the
   functionality of ecosystems (through deforestation and resulting
   siltation of rivers). Thus, we argue for an Ecohealth approach to energy
   justice research, drawing on evidence from Malawi's transition towards
   electrification.},

Title = {Energy justice within, between and beyond European community energy
   initiatives: A review},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent European policy efforts stimulate the emergence of community
   energy initiatives, and the European Commission explicitly aims to
   enable a just transition towards a low-carbon energy system. One of the
   prevalent assumptions is that fostering community energy will bring
   about energy justice. Intrigued by this assumption, we conduct an
   extending systematic literature review to explore how the notion of
   energy justice is discussed within scholarly work on community energy
   initiatives in Europe. We detected a tendency of community energy
   scholars to not (yet) fully employ the inherent scope the concept of
   energy justice entails. Therefore, we propose that community energy
   justice should be analyzed through three different lenses: energy
   justice occurring within community energy initiatives, between
   initiatives and related actors, and beyond initiatives. Extending the
   energy justice lens to address these different levels helps to better
   bring out the encompassing premise that the notion of energy justice
   entails, both analytically and in practice. Through our analysis
   different energy justice impacts come to the fore, for example related
   to social inequality: not all societal groups are equally positioned to
   benefit from policies focused on community initiatives. Considering the
   policy efforts to stimulate community energy development, we argue that
   these impacts can be amplified, due to cumulative power of many
   community energy initiatives together. Our contribution highlights that
   for making energy transitions just, a broader and more connected
   understanding of energy justice in the context of community energy
   initiatives is central.},

Title = {Conceptualising restorative justice in the energy Transition: Changing
   the perspectives of fossil fuels},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Restorative justice within the energy sector focuses on the needs of the
   victims, such as nations, citizens and nature. It restores them to their
   original position prior to a damaging activity. The importance of
   restorative justice is that it can be a proactive policy approach to
   preventing harm and conflict within the energy sector if applied and
   accounted for at the outset of an energy project or activity. For many
   years energy justice scholarship has had three tenets central to its
   core, however, this research focuses on restorative justice that has
   been advanced since 2017. This review aims to capture the addition of
   restorative justice and provides a comparative law and case study
   perspective and explores the application of restorative justice across
   three countries Iran, Malaysia, and Canada with a focus on the oil and
   gas sector. In what is a first in-depth exploration of restorative
   justice our results confirm that restorative justice if applied can act
   to ensure the enforcement of energy justice, i.e., moving from theory to
   practice. This research also highlights how there exists a number of
   legal tools that have restorative justice as a guiding principle such as
   the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, the Energy Financial
   Reserve Obligation (EFRO), and the Social License to Operate (SLO).
   These are gaining in application and can ensure restorative justice
   moves further from a conceptual theory to practice.},

Title = {When energy justice encounters authoritarian environmentalism: The case
   of clean heating energy transitions in rural China},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a burgeoning theoretical framework, energy justice has been mostly
   focused on the energy transition in Western countries, where
   socio-political settings are largely featured by liberalism and
   democracy, leaving an obvious gap in its application in other
   socio-political contexts. As a major energy consumer and a leader of the
   global low-carbon transition, China is characterized by a distinctive
   socio-political regime. An array of grand strategies to transform its
   coal-dominant energy structure have been initiated to ameliorate
   deteriorating environmental crises in particular and materialize a
   low-carbon transition in general. Based on extensive evidence, this
   article incorporates the energy justice framework into the analysis of
   an ongoing energy transition project in rural Northern China. It
   contributes to the related research in three dimensions. First,
   empirically, it demonstrates that the coal-to-gas heating transition
   project has been swamped with social injustices; the absence of measures
   to address these would lead this mega-project to profound failure.
   Second, theoretically, it illustrates that the concerns of justice are
   even more paramount in an authoritarian context where policy processes
   are characterized by strong political-administrative intervention and
   the pursuit of efficiency at all cost. In light of this, it stresses the
   indispensable role of restorative justice as a core tenet in achieving
   energy justice in authoritarian socio-political contexts, such as China.
   Third, this study advocates expanding the evaluation parameters of
   authoritarian environmentalism to include social consequences.},

Abstract = {Energy justice is an emerging concept that informs policymakers on the
   just distribution of, and access to energy services. However, research
   on how policy grounded in energy justice may facilitate greater
   intergenerational equity is few and far between. Additionally, energy
   justice as a decision-making framework has mostly been based in western
   thought, through its application in developed country contexts. The
   value of non-Western philosophies in advancing the energy justice
   literature has received little attention. In this paper, we address
   these gaps by drawing upon Amartya Sen's interpretation of the Hindu
   Bhagavad Gita, using this to conceptualise a temporal energy justice
   decision-making framework that builds on the Gita's time-based notions
   of ` dutyfocused' and ` consequence-sensitive' decision outcomes. We
   apply this framework to study India's energy landscape and underlying
   tensions, largely emanating from a steadfast policy focus on alleviating
   energy poverty in the short-term whilst also committing to a low carbon
   energy transition for the future. We advocate for the need to move
   beyond this dichotomous focus on duty versus consequence, and pursue a
   policy position reflected in the understanding of realised justice-an
   inclusive and comprehensive account of just outcomes from both an
   intra-and inter-generational perspective.},

Title = {Radical energy justice: a Green Deal for Romanian coal miners?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {This article proposes the energy justice framework can benefit from a
   radical reframing to expose broader structural injustices in the
   transitions towards a net-zero energy system. There are two objectives
   of this paper: First, is to outline how energy justice can provide a
   radical critique of injustices of the energy system - a more activist
   centered approach; and second, to use energy justice to identify who is
   responsible for unjust policies within the energy system. The second
   point is important to understand what is meant by a `just transition.'
   Who decides how others are compensated for the transition and the loss
   of their jobs? The theoretical limitation of energy justice is the
   normative framing which does not identify the structural causes of
   injustice and avoids identifying the source causing the structural
   injustice. This article develops and applies radical energy justice to
   the case of the Jiu Valley in Romania, a coal-mining region, and an
   early site for the European Union's Green Deal Just Transition
   Mechanism.},

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Up to \$61trillion of power systems investment is needed to fulfil the
   Paris Agreement. The mobilisation of so much capital is a huge
   challenge. As such, energy policy is changing to meet the needs of
   commercial finance. However, very little has been done to question the
   justice implications of this capital mobilisation, and what alternatives
   there are to commercially-oriented finance for low carbon energy
   systems. This paper uses a comparative analysis of two developed
   economies to explore how `alternative' forms of finance operate in each
   nation's energy investment landscape. We find alternative finance is
   often set in opposition to commercial capital. Alternative finance in
   both nations is motivated by financial justice outcomes that are poorly
   understood in current energy policy. Our findings suggest that 6
   principles are key to `just' energy finance: affordability, good
   governance, due process, intra-generational equity, spatial equity, and
   financial resilience. Energy policy that seeks to mobilise capital,
   should take account of all six principles.},

Title = {Prioritizing mitigation efforts considering co-benefits, equity and
   energy justice: Fossil fuel to renewable energy transition pathways},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {187-198},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy (RE) is one of the
   core strategies in developing sustainable future energy systems. But in
   planning such a transition, it is common to consider primarily cost and
   greenhouse gas reduction, as typified by cost-mitigation curves that
   have become widespread. Such assessments tend to leave important
   considerations of energy justice on the periphery. This paper puts
   forward an alternative assessment technique, incorporating various
   indicators of social equity in order to assess the priority of power
   plant replacement that would lead to the greatest improvement in
   benefits, while placing the burden of system changes away from the most
   vulnerable. An example of the application of this approach is presented
   for prioritization of the retirement and replacement (with RE) of
   Australia s ageing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The assessment
   shows very different results from a standard cost-mitigation approach,
   with the retirement of the large brown coal power plants (including the
   recently retired Hazelwood power plant) and the replacement with wind
   power (where applicable) promoting the best overall outcomes on both
   cost and equity. Considering a selection of high priority indicators
   with many locally-specific data sets, the approach adds significant
   contextual relevance to prioritization, and is considered to offer
   useful findings for policy-makers.},

   establishes a conceptual linkage between ``sustainable development{''},

   that linking social priorities to energy justice provides a useful
   contribution for energy policy makers toward a better understanding of
   the multidimensional and complex aspects of low-carbon energy
   transitions, and how different segments of society prioritize and
   perceive them for the achievement of socially just energy decisions.},

Title = {From energy privilege to energy justice: A framework for embedded
   sustainable development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Addressing concerns of justice related to energy has gained increased
   international attention with the adoption of the United Nation's
   Sustainable Development Goals. However, scholarship has largely
   neglected connections between the concepts of sustainable development
   and energy justice, and offers few related evaluative tools. Moreover,
   the dominant energy development paradigm-what I term `energy
   privilege'-has received limited attention and theoretical grounding. By
   critically engaging theory from Karl Polanyi with concepts from
   environmental justice and political theory, the article develops a
   framework to differentiate between `embedded' and `disembedded'
   sustainable development. This framework is then applied to develop a set
   of principles and criteria by which energy projects, initiatives, and
   systems can be assessed in terms of contributing to energy justice as
   compared to energy privilege. The resulting framework focuses on how
   energy-related resources, rights, and representation take shape across
   the three interlocking spheres of sustainable development: the economic,
   the environmental, and the social. It provides a practicable tool for
   communities and decision-makers to evaluate the extent to which
   individual projects and broader energy systems are both just and
   sustainable.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To achieve national energy and climate targets across the world, there
   is a key focus on solar energy development. It is clear from literature
   that many countries have enormous, under-utilised potentials for solar
   energy, which can significantly change their energy mix and contribute
   to the low-carbon ambitions they signed up to under the 2015 Paris
   Agreement. Our research highlights that there are benefits to solar
   energy development from a law and economic perspective that are still
   underexplored. These benefits centre on justice and on how solar energy
   increases justice within the energy system. From a legal perspective, we
   review 72 countries and their introduction of energy law with respect to
   solar energy development. Our analysis illustrates that in some
   developing countries (new) legislation was not associated with a
   significant increase in the share of solar energy in the energy mix. We
   then highlight how to achieve solar energy development through law that
   can provide certainty for investment. Furthermore, we stress the
   importance of flexibility that allows the full potential of solar energy
   to be realised within the energy system. The corresponding form of
   flexibility justice, combining law and economics, can contribute to
   increased economic welfare based on market reforms that centre on new
   market design and market access, while ensuring that it keeps pace with
   ongoing developments in technology, cost, and ownership.},

Year = {2016},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Energy justice has emerged as a new crosscutting social science research
   agenda which seeks to apply justice principles to energy policy, energy
   production and systems, energy consumption, energy activism, energy
   security and climate change. A conceptual review is now required for the
   consolidation and logical extension of this field. Within this
   exploration, we give an account of its core tenets: distributional,
   recognition and procedural. Later we promote the application of this
   three-pronged approach across the energy system, within the global
   context of energy production and consumption. Thus, we offer both a
   conceptual review and a research agenda. Throughout, we explore the key
   dimensions of this new agenda - its evaluative and normative
   reach-demonstrating that energy justice offers, firstly, an opportunity
   to explore where injustices occur, developing new processes of avoidance
   and remediation and recognizing new sections of society. Secondly, we
   illustrate that energy justice provides a new stimulating framework for
   bridging existing and future research on energy production and
   consumption when whole energy systems approaches are integrated into
   research designs. In conclusion, we suggest three areas for future
   research: investigating the non-activist origins of energy justice,
   engaging with economics, and uniting systems of production and
   consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Harvesting lithium and sun in the Andes: Exploring energy justice and
   the new materialities of energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper states that energy transition, being materially grounded,
   leads to the social construction of resources, such as lithium, and new
   forms of energy production, such as solar energy. The phenomenon
   proceeds through public and entrepreneurial green discourses
   positivizing these forms of extraction, presented by their promoters as
   sustainable activities. This contributes both to local and global energy
   transition towards carbon zero behaviours and sustainable development in
   Argentina and Chile. A geohistorical approach of the territory and the
   first geohistory of the extractive companies (seniority, know-how and
   territorial anchorage) in the region help to better understand the
   ongoing territorial turn of marginal territories and local resource
   commodification in the territory we call: Altiplania. From a State and
   entrepreneurial perspective, local lithium and solar exploitation and
   connections can be analyzed as a self-sustaining cycle of energy
   transition that reinforces local energy transition by strengthening
   local networks and enlarging energy access in remote areas. However, the
   process can also be read as a continuum of green grabbing practices
   developed by mining and energy stakeholders which reinforce and even
   extend pre-existing processes of commodification of nature and
   accumulation in the region for extra local purposes and, questions the
   role that energy transition policies and associated infrastructures may
   play in entranching spatial unevenness and socio-environmental and
   energy (in)justices.},

Title = {Energy justice gaps in renewable energy transition policy initiatives in
   Vermont},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {159},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines how renewable energy policies in Vermont address
   energy vulnerability and energy justice. Using an anti-resilience
   framework, and drawing on 569 surveys and 18 interviews statewide, our
   results demonstrate higher energy vulnerability-lack of access to
   sufficient and affordable energy-among respondents who are low-income,
   non-white, and renters. Low-income and renter respondents were over
   three times more likely, and non-white respondents were seven times more
   likely, to report going without heat. While Vermont is regarded as a
   renewable energy leader, its current policies do not equitably
   distribute household transition benefits (HTBs) to address
   vulnerability. Our results show that non-white respondents were seven
   times less likely than white respondents to report having solar panels
   and renters were three times less likely than homeowners to report
   having solar panels. Interviews also reveal HTBs are available mostly to
   high-income households. We argue that these disparities may result from
   structural discrimination and policies that distribute HTBs to
   households with disposable income and property rights. The unequal
   distribution of this `investment capital' prevents widespread access for
   non-white, low-income, and renting households. Following an
   anti-resilience framework, we propose alternative policy frameworks that
   center justice within energy transition policy making.},

Title = {The role of organized publics in articulating the exnovation of
   fossil-fuel technologies for intra- and intergenerational energy justice
   in energy transitions},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {339-350},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Whereas campaigners for energy justice frequently seek to achieve
   decarbonization through innovation, little light has been shed on how
   energy justice might be won through the removal of carbon intensive
   energy structures a process known as exnovation, which is the opposite
   of innovation. Whereas practicing exnovation to decarbonize energy
   systems and thus achieving greater energy justice appears to be a
   promising approach, it remains a challenge in light of the deep
   incumbency of established fossil-fuel-based energy industries. Using the
   example of Germany, which represents such a setting of deep fossil fuel
   incumbency, this article compares two organizations aiming to achieve
   energy justice via exnovation when formal policy-making toward
   decarbonization seems impossible. Offering a perspective on strategies
   for energy justice, the article identifies the repertoires of contention
   of two organizations. This concerns knowledge dissemination, symbolic
   protest, and rule compliance, which can be understood as soft
   (non-obligatory) policy instruments to bring about exnovation. The
   article then discusses the relationship between exnovation and intra-
   and intergenerational energy justice. It concludes that the means of
   contention analyzed here are successful in divesting and in stopping the
   construction of planned coal plants.},

Title = {A critical review of energy democracy: A failure to deliver justice?},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Y The concept of energy democracy has seen a moderate rise in
   scholarship over the last decade. This article is the first to examine
   the concept of energy democracy from a critical perspective, and it is
   advanced here that the concept is limited and narrow. Further, through
   analysing it through the JUST Framework it is clear that energy
   democracy fails to deliver real justice. The JUST Framework takes us
   through core justice issues, such as distributive, procedural,
   restorative, recognition and cosmopolitanism. Further, it explores the
   space and time dimensions which bring a more practical perspective on
   the concept. Energy democracy scholars in the recent past (in 2019 and
   2020) have sought to broaden the concept. However, as this article
   shows, these debates exist in the literature already, and energy justice
   and just transition issues go much further and are already more
   developed and utilised by researchers. In addition, the energy democracy
   concept is limited in the main part to local communities and ignores key
   issues such as energy extraction activities and indigenous communities.
   To conclude, and to achieve action, we call on energy democracy scholars
   to engage in the just energy transition literature and to contribute to
   the decrease of the language war that is progressively affecting the
   field of energy studies addressing the challenges of an accelerated
   transition to a lower-carbon economy.},

Title = {An analysis of energy justice programs across the United States},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The energy transition that is developing across the United States is
   producing both winners and losers. While some individuals, households
   and communities are reaping the benefits of the move toward cleaner,
   renewable sources of energy, others are experiencing its adverse
   effects, such as disruptions to labor markets, higher energy prices, and
   pollution and health burdens. To address these disparities, policymakers
   are increasingly calling for energy justice. However, there is scant
   scholarly literature on either the prevalence or characteristics of
   energy justice programs that already exist. Here we show that energy
   justice programs are both quite widespread and diverse across the United
   States, are most often led by nonprofit organizations rather than
   government agencies, and, while many share common missions, programs
   entail unique and often innovative strategies to achieve their
   objectives. The analysis lends important insights into current energy
   justice programs, but we argue deeper evaluation is necessary to
   identify which efforts are efficacious.},

Abstract = {The continuation and exacerbation of many environmental failures

   what does it add that environmental and climate justice cannot? To
   answer this question this perspective outlines the origins, successes
   and failures of the environmental and climate justice concepts, with a
   view to both distinguishing the energy justice field, and providing
   cautionary tales for it. It then outlines three points of departure,
   which it argues increases the opportunity of success for the energy
   justice concept: (1) ``bounding out{''}, (2) non-anti-establishment
   pasts and (3) methodological strength. This paper exists to stimulate

Title = {Balancing the energy trilemma through the Energy Justice Metric},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {229},
Pages = {1191-1201},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Energy justice is a fast emerging research and policy tool which
   captures the injustices across the energy life cycle, i.e., from
   `cradle-to-grave'. The Energy Justice Metric (EJM) quantifies energy
   justice through analyzing the energy justice performance of different
   countries utilising data from international institutions and national
   governments. This paper identifies why there is a need for a modeling
   tool such as the EJM which focuses on the full energy life-cycle and
   also has a distributive (inequality-correcting) oriented approach. The
   EJM demonstrates how a country can achieve an improved balance between
   the three competing aims of the energy trilemma, i.e. economics,
   politics and the environment. A key feature of the RIM is modeling
   energy justice using a ternary plot where the energy justice performance
   of a country can be transferred directly onto the energy trilemma. In
   this paper, five countries are analysed, the US, UK, Germany, Denmark
   and Ireland. The EJM presents a research and policy decision-making tool
   that can contribute to the growing literature that tackles the issue of
   inequality in society, and informs on society's decision on which energy
   source would be more just for a society to build.},

Title = {Contestation, contingency, and justice in the Nordic low-carbon energy
   transition},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},

Abstract = {The five Nordic countries have aggressive climate and energy policies in
   place and have already emerged to be leaders in renewable energy and
   energy efficiency. Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind
   energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and
   Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually ``fossil
   free{''} by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition
   through the lens of three interconnected research questions: How are
   they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result
   for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary
   for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals. It argues
   that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and
   renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable
   forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of
   residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and
   storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows
   emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must
   confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and
   social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with
   implications for what such historical progress, and future transition
   pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners.},

Title = {The Energy Transition: Democracy, Justice and Good Regulation of the
   Heat Market},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper discusses whether the concepts of energy democracy, energy
   justice and the principles of good market regulation could play a role
   in developing a more consistent approach towards the regulation of the
   energy sector. It is concluded that the principles of good regulation
   can provide a useful framework within which advantages and disadvantages
   can be weighed of regulatory choices to be made when modernizing the
   regulation of the energy markets. A case study of the Dutch heat market
   is used as an example, showing that a lot remains to be gained in terms
   of flexible regulation and supervision and the facilitation of citizen
   participation. Both energy democracy and energy justice call for this.
   The lack of flexibility in the current regulatory framework could lead
   to ineffective and disproportionate regulation, hindering a sustainable,
   reliable and affordable development of the heat market. A larger need
   for flexibility is justified because of the differences between the
   types of heat networks. Customized solutions regarding unbundling and
   third-party access, including the modernization of the heat market, also
   require sufficient discretionary powers for the independent regulator
   that do not hinder but in fact stimulate the development of the heat
   market. Furthermore, increased citizen-participation is important in
   light of energy justice and energy democracy, which are energy specific
   concepts that overarch the principles of good regulation in the energy
   sector. Both concepts are based on the awareness that the energy
   transition is a matter for all citizens of the European Union and should
   not be ignored by policymakers and independent regulators. Since it is
   likely that most heat consumers will remain locked in for a relatively
   long time in natural monopolies facilitated by older generation heat
   networks and a lack of alternatives, substantive citizen-participation
   could yield positive results regarding community engagement in heat
   network management and heat supply.},

Title = {Proximities of energy justice: contesting community energy and austerity
   in England},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Spatial inequities are deeply embedded in low-carbon energy transition
   processes. As a result, new forms of contestation are emerging that
   reveal social inequalities at the heart of community-led responses to
   climate change. This paper uses four tenets of energy justice -
   distributional, procedural, restorative and recognition justice - to
   critically analyse and understand the politics and geography of local
   renewable energy deployment in Bristol, England. Focusing on the
   development of two solar PV farms in and around Lawrence Weston, an area
   of high deprivation in North West Bristol, the paper demonstrates the
   critical nature of instances of both energy justice and injustice in a
   time of austerity. Using primary data obtained via a Participatory
   Action Research (PAR) approach in Bristol during 2015-2017, the paper
   draws on participant observation data and in-depth interviews (n = 10)
   with a variety of local energy actors and community members active in
   Lawrence Weston. The primary data details the extent to which spatial
   configurations of new low-carbon energy infrastructures are integral to
   their justice implications. Indeed, it is the proximity of projects both
   close to and within the Lawrence Weston community that shapes the
   participant's thoughts and deliberations on how to achieve local energy
   justice, through appeal to the four tenets outlined.
   The findings emphasise the distributional justice impacts of creating
   new low-carbon energy infrastructures in deprived communities in a time
   of austerity, whilst also noting that `opening up' local energy
   transitions to greater input from local communities' offers
   opportunities to achieve procedural justice. Shifting relationships
   between local energy actors and Lawrence Weston highlight opportunities
   for the remediation of past claims of injustice, facilitating processes
   of restorative justice, whilst local energy schemes that seek to advance
   greater `active participant' (skills training \& employment)
   opportunities for deprived communities in which they, or their projects,
   are embedded, may be underpinned by recognition justice concerns. This
   `active participant' approach is shown to be key to advancing beyond
   `passive recipient' approaches to community energy transitions and
   enhancing spatial equity. Finally, the paper offers novel empirical
   insights into the contested role of geography, space and place in local
   transitions and contributes to bottom-up perspectives on issues of
   spatial (in) justice in community energy schemes.},

Title = {Intermediating energy justice? The role of intermediaries in the civic
   energy for sector in a time of austerity},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {226},
Pages = {71-81},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to emerging local perspectives on energy justice.
   Examining the critical influence of intermediary organisations, we draw
   on the nascent concept of a `civic energy sector' to frame `local'
   engagement in low-carbon energy systems. Applying the three core tenets
   of energy justice - distributional, procedural and recognition justice -
   to organisations in the UK city of Bristol's growing civic energy
   sector, we demonstrate the explanatory power and real-world
   applicability of energy justice at the local level.
   The paper draws on a set of rich qualitative data collected over 18
   months during 2015-2017, using methods from the Participatory Action
   Research methodology. This includes both in-depth interviews (n = 12)
   and a focus group (n = 7) with key civic energy actors in Bristol,
   alongside embedded activist researcher approaches and document analysis
   of important outputs and publications from civic energy actors. Using
   the three tenets, the paper shows how intermediaries act as a critical
   bridge between local low-carbon energy initiatives and deprived
   communities; raise awareness of funding opportunities to otherwise
   excluded community groups, and, where possible, seek to localise the
   emerging economic benefits of low-carbon transitions.
   The paper finishes with a call for energy justice researchers to
   collaborate more closely with organisations facilitating local
   low-carbon transitions, alongside suggesting efforts are needed to push
   for a commonly understood framework of energy justice within civic
   energy networks. It also offers critical reflections on the dominant
   theoretical framing of energy justice and the limitations of
   intermediaries under austerity, while providing policy-relevant
   recommendations to facilitate energy justice.},

Title = {Working to align energy transitions and social equity: An integrative
   framework linking institutional work, imaginaries and energy justice},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent academic evidence suggests that, in contrast to what is often
   thought, the introduction of renewable energy infrastructures often
   leads to negative, not positive, social equity outcomes. Against this
   background, this paper aims to develop and empirically illustrate an
   integrative framework for analysing the work - or `agency' - exercised
   by actors operating within and across different global contexts to align
   renewable energy and social equity. To this end, the paper first reviews
   three generative conceptions of agency in the energy transitions
   literature: institutional work, imaginaries and energy justice. In
   reviewing their explanatory power as well as their shortcomings, the
   paper concludes that these different conceptions of agency can be
   integrated meaningfully in an expanded conceptualisation of
   institutional work that spans three distinct domains: i) `reimagining',
   ii) `recoding' and iii) `reconfiguring'. This article demonstrates that
   the three domains can be understood to reiteratively feed into each
   other in what we call the `triple re-cycle'. These iterations produce
   either bolstering effects that strengthen the potential for positive
   social equity outcomes or evaporative effects that diminish or undermine
   this potential. We empirically illustrate the framework in case studies
   from Germany and South Africa. Overall, we argue that the triple
   re-cycle, as a heuristic, can provide new insights by conceptually
   connecting multiple domains of agency in energy transitions, including
   discursive and material aspects, across different global contexts. Our
   hope is that identifying potential agency in this way supports work to
   improve the social equity outcomes of energy transitions globally.},

Title = {Do renewable energy communities deliver energy justice? Exploring
   insights from 71 European cases},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A growing energy justice literature underlines that complex energy
   injustices in energy transition disproportionally affect vulnerable and
   energy-poor households. Literature and policies discuss renewable energy
   communities' (RECs) potential to enable citizen participation in energy
   transition and shape a just transition. Low-income and energy-poor
   households could benefit from granting access to affordable energy
   tariffs and energy efficiency measures when participating in RECs.
   Recent EU legislation highlights RECs' social role in energy poverty
   alleviation and stipulates the participation of all social groups in
   RECs, especially those groups that are underrepresented under RECs'
   members. In this light, the energy justice framework is increasingly
   applied to analyse RECs' social contributions in different countries.
   Still, empirical evidence of RECs' capacity to include underrepresented
   and vulnerable groups and mitigate energy poverty as a particular form
   of energy justice remains scarce. Drawing on data collected among 71
   European RECs, our exploratory research investigates how RECs engage in
   this social role by improving participatory procedures to enable
   vulnerable groups' participation and by distributing affordable energy
   and energy efficiency to vulnerable households. Using the energy justice
   framework, we explore how RECs resonate with the three energy justice
   tenets (distributive, recognitional and procedural) by addressing
   underrepresented groups and energy poverty.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy transitions are essential for decarbonizing the world
   economy and mitigating global climate change. Yet many energy
   technologies classified as renewable have human health and livelihood
   implications that jeopardize the lives and wellbeing of those already
   most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this
   study is thus to summarize the documented environmental justice (EJ)
   impacts associated with renewable energy technologies included in many
   renewable energy policies globally. Our motivation for this study is to
   ensure that renewable energy policies incorporate concerns for justice
   into their formulation and implementation. We provide a systematic
   review of the literature assessing renewable energy technologies from
   the perspective of distributive, procedural, recognition, and capability
   interpretations of environmental justice. Our review finds that there
   are ten common renewable energy technologies that have EJ implications

Title = {Energy justice at the end of the wire: Enacting community energy and
   equity in Wales},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {649-657},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Energy justice has emerged as a useful lens for understanding and
   guiding energy decision-making. However, whilst calls for greater energy
   justice have grown, fleeting attention has been paid to the role and
   agency of the very people at the heart of this agenda. Clearly, given
   the increasing prevalence of local energy initiatives, such projects
   warrant more sustained focus both to explore how energy justice is
   constructed between settings and to prompt greater consideration of its
   associated outcomes. This paper seeks to address this gap by using
   energy justice to assess local ownership of small scale energy
   generation through a study of the community energy sector in Wales. In
   so doing, it aids greater understanding of the energy equity dimension,
   understood in terms of accessibility and affordability, of the energy
   trilemma. From a conceptual standpoint, the research examines how energy
   justice is negotiated and contested at community-scale through a focus
   on issues of distributive and procedural justice. From a policy
   standpoint, the research shows that community energy is often involved
   in a wide range of local objectives and directs attention to how best to
   support such initiatives to further stimulate local action and deliver
   more widespread equity gains.},

Title = {Substantiating Energy Justice: Creating a Space to Understand Energy
   Dilemmas},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This paper explores the relationships between the moral philosophical
   foundations and strategic goals of two conceptions of energy justice:
   the ``triumvirate conception{''} and the ``principled approach{''}. We
   explore the extent to which the goals of these approaches align with
   their core aims and strategies. Having initially been developed to
   capture and reflect the values of activist-led environmental justice
   movements, we find that the triumvirate approach's adoption of a
   trivalent conception of justice currently lies in tension with its
   overarching top-down approach. We note that the principled approach does
   not face the same tensions as the triumvirate conception of energy
   justice, but would benefit from illustrating the consequences of framing
   the same energy dilemma with conflicting moral theories. Aiming to
   ameliorate these limitations and further develop conceptions of energy
   justice, we outline a case study of hydro power in Hirakud, India and
   propose a framework which illustrates how using differing theories of
   justice to conceptualise the same energy dilemmas can result in
   substantially different normative framings and guidance. We illustrate
   how this framework, combined with a pluralistic appeal to moral theory,
   can enable both approaches to draw on a wider range of moral theory to
   assess energy dilemmas. This in turn provides a broader socio-political
   backdrop in which to view energy dilemmas. We outline how this backdrop
   contributes to the creation of a space in which the grievances of those
   who suffer in relation to energy systems can be heard and better
   understood.},

Title = {Innovative but unjust? Analysing the opportunities and justice issues
   within positive energy districts in Europe},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The current energy transition focuses on decarbonisation through the use
   of renewable energy sources, coupled with improvements in efficiency by
   means of technological innovations. However, there is also a clear call
   for realizing a just transition. The implementation of smart
   technology-led transitions and low-carbon energy system innovations is
   increasingly urged to become more people-centred by taking energy
   poverty and other justice related issues into account. Energy justice
   and energy poverty debates already transcend narrow foci on income and
   energy expenditure ratios and have moved towards multidimensional
   approaches (Bouzarovski and Petrova, 2015) {[}1]. In addition, the
   capability approach (CA) has been used to understand energy deprivation
   (Day et al., 2016) {[}2]. We further develop these approaches to better
   understand justice relevant issues within Positive Energy Districts,
   especially by looking at how opportunity spaces for realizing wellbeing
   are created. The primary goal is to establish a CA-informed framework
   for analysing justice-relevant issues within the development of Positive
   Energy Districts, based on a systematic literature search. Hereby we
   contribute to the discussion on usage of the CA within the field of
   energy and to the debate on how to frame technological innovations, such
   that they can contribute to a just transition.},

Title = {Women's leadership in renewable transformation, energy justice and
   energy democracy: Redistributing power},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As women take on more leadership roles in the United States advancing
   social and political change, analysis of women's contributions to the
   transformation occurring within the energy sector is critically
   important. Grassroots movements focused on energy justice and energy
   democracy focus on: (1) resisting the power of large multinational
   fossil fuel energy companies that exacerbate inequities and disparities
   in energy, (2) reclaiming the energy sector with more community and
   public control to redisitrbute benefits and risks, and (3) restructuring
   the energy sector to prioritize equity and justice with community
   ownership and distributed governance. This research analyzes women's
   leadership by focusing on how two women-led, non-profit organizations
   are advancing the renewable energy transition, operationalizing the
   concept of energy democracy and contributing to the energy justice
   movement. The two organizations are Grid Alternatives, a solar
   installation and workforce training organization, and Mothers Out Front,
   an advocacy organization focused on addressing climate change by
   promoting a transition to renewable energy. These organizations differ
   in their mission and approaches, yet both intentionally link climate and
   energy action with other forms of social justice activism, by expanding
   community engagement, strengthening participation, and fundamentally
   redistributing power to promote a transition to more equitable,
   resilient and sustainable energy systems. This paper contributes to the
   theoretical understanding of gender in energy justice and energy
   democracy movements, and to the practical consideration of the role that
   women's leadership is playing in accelerating energy system change and
   advancing the principles of energy justice and energy democracy.},

Title = {Mitigating inequality with emissions? Exploring energy justice and
   financing transitions to low carbon energy in Indonesia},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many countries around the globe demonstrate a growing commitment to
   achieve universal electrification in alignment with Sustainable
   Development Goal 7. Indonesia is among the countries that have made a
   concerted effort to alleviate energy poverty, mindful that around 25
   million of its citizens live without access to electricity. This article
   examines Indonesia's efforts to realize its vision of energy justice by
   mobilizing private finance for renewable rural electrification. In
   particular, it investigates to what extent and in what ways Indonesia
   has addressed energy justice issues and their social implications.
   Interviews and document analysis reveal that Indonesia's energy justice
   vision has manifested in policies and initiatives that focus narrowly on
   distributive energy justice in terms of energy accessibility and
   affordability. However, procedural and recognition aspects of energy
   justice remain unaddressed. Such a myopic interpretation of energy
   justice has resulted in policies that prioritize large scale and on-grid
   solutions and substantially reduce financial options for small and
   distributed renewable energy initiatives. It also perpetuates spatial
   inequality and reinforces the exclusion and disempowerment of energy
   poor communities from energy decisions. The findings suggest that for a
   broader energy justice vision to be realized, it will be necessary to
   design and implement energy policies that holistically address all
   elements of energy justice and facilitate the use of diverse forms of
   finance to address energy poverty.},

Title = {How to avoid unjust energy transitions: insights from the Ruhr region},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background The transition of the Ruhr region in Germany from a hard coal
   belt into a knowledge-based economy with a dynamic service sector and
   state of the art universities over the past 60-80 years has been widely
   touted as a successful example of how just and fair low carbon energy
   transitions can unfold. Methods This paper leverages documentary
   analysis of data across a wide array of sources to test these claims and
   identify lessons by creating a novel just energy transition framework.
   Results The study finds economic motivation, mindset and
   reorientation-not environmental concerns-to be the defining features for
   at least the first two decades of this shift. The lack of willingness to
   acknowledge environmental impacts and market realities has delayed the
   transition and led to wasteful allocation of resources towards
   supporting the hard coal mining industry. The prominence given to
   distributional justice cushions the victims of this transition
   financially, but does not allow a broad based coalition to advance the
   transition process. It is in the second phase (mid-1980s onwards that we
   see procedural aspects of justice come forth and support greater
   ownership and sustainability of the transition to emerge, while the
   evidence of recognition justice continues to be scant. Conclusions There
   are many nuanced successes in the Ruhr's example, along with some
   failures worth highlighting. It is in the breakdown of this transition
   into two distinct phases and their nuances (particularly in the domain
   of justice) that fresh insights emerge and allow for a better
   understanding of what constitutes a suitable energy transition in a
   particular socio-economic and political context. As the international
   community embarks on ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, it can
   maximise the benefits and minimise the damages and costs by considering
   these realities on the ground.},

Title = {Mobility justice in low carbon energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {109-117},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mobility systems raise multiple questions of justice. Work on mobility
   justice and policy often treats different elements of the debate
   separately, for example focussing on environmental justice or
   accessibility. This is problematic as it can privilege policy solutions
   without a full view of the winners and losers and the values implicit in
   that. Using analysis of current policy, we investigate how mobility
   justice can reconcile its different components, and find two major
   consequences. First, is doubt about the justice of the existing policy
   approach which tries to tackle transport pollution primarily through a
   shift to low emission vehicles. This approach privileges those with
   access to private vehicles and further privileges certain sets of
   activities. Second is a need to reassess which basic normative ideas
   should be applied in mobility justice. Work on mobility justice has
   tended to appeal to conceptions of justice concerned with access to
   resources including resources enabling mobility. These conceptions say
   little about how resources should be used. We show that avoiding stark
   inequalities means collectively thinking about how resources are used,
   about how we value activities involving mobility, and about what sorts
   of goods and services we create. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {In recent years, the concept of ``energy justice{''} has attracted much
   attention and research effort. Although all policy issues related to
   energy justice are worthy of further study, the time constraints posed
   by the looming threat of climate change suggests the need for
   coordinated policy research efforts. At the current stage of development
   of European societies, we consider that four policy research strands
   might be most important in the light of specific evolving trends of
   European energy systems. Therefore, we propose these priorities as a
   shared research agenda for academic and policy researchers. In this
   article, we develop and discuss the following four research priority
   strands: (a) intergenerational justice and energy justice, (b) justice
   and energy vulnerability, (c) transformation of the social imaginary and
   energy infrastructure, and (d) damage, compensation, and energy
   infrastructure. For each topic, we highlight their critical issues and
   research opportunities. We conclude that these priorities are necessary
   not only to accelerate the energy transition but also to avoid negative
   impacts that climate change and the transition phase could produce on
   already established patterns of inequality.},

Title = {Energy poverty and the role of institutions: exploring procedural energy
   justice - Ombudsman in focus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {This paper aims to explore the role of institutions, and specifically of
   the Ombudsman, in creating and practicing policies with relevance to
   energy poverty as a case of procedural energy (in)justice in a European
   context, while refining procedural energy justice. It is empirically
   informed by studies about the Austrian energy utility-based Ombudsman
   and the independent Ombudsman in North Macedonia, countries with a low
   and high level of energy poverty, respectively. I highlight the
   unexplored institutional capacity of the independent Ombudsman to
   discover hidden institutional energy poverty drivers, and the
   utility-based Ombudsman to alleviate energy poverty, and contribute to a
   socially just energy transition. The energy market and social welfare
   system are important institutions co-shaping energy poverty, and the
   energy utility plays an especially relevant role in creating or
   preventing energy injustices. Procedural energy justice applied to
   energy poverty is about how institutions treat citizens over access to
   affordable energy, and how citizens are (dis)empowered by that
   relationship.},

Title = {Towards a new social science research agenda for hydrogen transitions:
   Social practices, energy justice, and place attachment},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years hydrogen has been repositioned as potentially playing an
   important role in the decarbonisation of global energy consumption,
   particularly the decarbonisation of heat. Reflecting a recognition that
   public support will be central to its success or failure, a body of
   research has emerged investigating public perceptions of hydrogen in a
   range of different contexts. The majority of this research has followed
   quantitative, positivist understandings of human behaviour and has
   attempted to pinpoint specific factors that determine hydrogen
   acceptance. This article proposes a different research agenda for
   hydrogen transitions, one that is necessary and urgent due to hydrogen's
   introduction to domestic gas supplies as a fuel for homes. The article
   argues that the approaches of current hydrogen perceptions research have
   a limited ability to understand and interpret the social and economic
   transformations that may occur as a result of this change. In doing so,
   it identifies and conceptualises three areas for further research: how
   hydrogen has the potential to impact gas-energised social practices of
   heating and cooking in the home; how it may shift lived experiences of
   fuel poverty and energy injustice; and how it may disrupt or enhance
   place attachments of the communities within which it will begin to be
   deployed. To illustrate the argument, the article presents findings from
   a research project exploring public perceptions of hydrogen blending in
   the United Kingdom. Drawing on these findings, it is shown how
   researching the potential impacts of emerging hydrogen transitions will
   require a broader and deeper engagement with theories of social
   practice, energy justice, and place attachment. The article concludes by
   summarising the implications of the argument for hydrogen researchers
   and pointing towards the challenges and opportunities of a new social
   science research agenda for hydrogen.},

Title = {Just transition management: Balancing just outcomes with just processes
   in Australian renewable energy transitions},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {225},
Pages = {110-123},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Transitioning electricity generation sectors to renewable energy is a
   necessary element of climate change mitigation but a challenging one
   with years of technical and social lock-in creating considerable inertia
   and a pace of change insufficient to meet the task. Transition
   management has emerged as a promising approach to proactively manage and
   accelerate transitions in sectors like energy and water and has the
   potential to do so in manner that would help secure energy justice.
   However, the approach has been criticised for ignoring the political
   dynamics of transitions, risking procedural and recognition injustice
   for traditional energy production regions while increasing opposition to
   a transition. This paper uses a qualitative case study approach to
   understand how a transition to renewable energy generation could be
   achieved in a way that secures energy justice for traditional energy
   production regions like those of Gladstone in the Australian state of
   Queensland. The paper augments the transition management approach with
   the ``just transitions{''} concept, which has emerged from labour
   movements as a means to mitigate negative impacts on workers and
   communities in traditional energy production regions, to create a ``Just
   Transition Management{''} framework that is applied as a diagnostic tool
   to the case study. While results suggest a transition is imminent within
   Queensland, a lack of: consistent, supportive federal policy; long-term
   visions, and a clear process leaves it at risk of being captured by the
   powerful incumbent resources sector utilising an ``environment vs.
   jobs{''} narrative. Yet, the results also suggest that adopting a just
   transition management approach has the potential to successfully resist
   the influence of the resources sector, by providing cheap, secure
   renewable energy and supporting affected workers into roles in the
   renewable energy sector using a reflexive, representative network
   governance approach. Data analysis reveals how the application of just
   transition principles has already engaged communities and unions that
   were previously sceptical of renewable energy. Overall, this study
   suggests that the just transition management framework assists in
   identifying the political barriers to transitions and energy justice
   more broadly, while also providing a management approach which creates
   powerful niche actor-networks to counter the narratives and influence of
   the incumbent resource sector. Thus it could support successful
   transitions that achieve the distributional, recognition and procedural
   justice needed for energy justice globally.},

Title = {Overcoming energy injustice? Bulgaria's renewable energy transition in
   times of crisis},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The effects of renewable energy transitions on energy costs and economic
   growth have led to cost concerns and a prioritisation of economic issues
   during the economic crisis. Bulgaria, the EU's poorest state has
   nevertheless already achieved its 2020 renewable energy targets. This
   achievement seems to challenge the widely held assumption that poorer
   countries struggle to meet environmental objectives. This paper analyses
   the drivers and implications of Bulgaria's renewables expansion in order
   to test general expectations on influential factors shaping renewable
   energy transitions in the context of poor states. The analysis employs
   the energy justice framework to identify the justice, equity and
   fairness implications of Bulgaria's renewable energy for its energy
   system. Despite the clear justice implications raised by changing energy
   systems, there are limited pieces analysing the relationship between
   renewable energy transitions and energy justice. The analysis shows that
   whilst Bulgaria was able to reach its renewables targets, the
   mismanaged, opaque and corrupted policy framework undermines the
   longterm viability of its energy transition. The analysis confirms the
   importance of long term strategies, effective policies and a supportive
   macroeconomic context for renewable energy transitions, and highlights
   the negative implications of renewables to achieve greater energy
   justice if these factors are omitted.},

Title = {Towards a multi-scalar and multi-horizon framework of energy injustice:
   A whole systems analysis of Estonian energy transition},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The shift from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy systems has
   profound justice implications as some regions are likely to lose as much
   as gain from decarbonization processes. Increasing calls have been made
   to adopt a `whole systems' perspective on energy justice. Drawing on the
   Multi-level Perspective on socio-technical transitions this paper
   presents a new comprehensive framework of energy justice in system
   innovation, proposing to map injustices along three dimensions: 1)
   multiple spatial scales (regional, national, international); 2)
   different time horizons (currently experienced vs. anticipated
   injustices); 3) connections to transition dynamics (injustices related
   to the optimization of the currently dominant system, destabilization of
   the incumbent system or the acceleration of alternative solutions in
   niches). The framework is applied to analyse the ongoing energy
   transition in Estonia, involving interactions between the incumbent oil
   shale based regime and wind, solar, nuclear and bioenergy as emerging
   niche challengers. The content analysis of news items in Estonian media
   reveals an inventory of 214 distinct incidents of energy injustices
   across 21 different categories. We find that many experienced and
   anticipated injustices are deployed, often strategically, by certain
   actors to advocate specific energy futures and to influence current
   political choices. From the justice perspective our analysis thus raises
   a question whether it is ethical to use probable yet currently
   unrealized injustices related to regime destabilization and niche
   acceleration as a means to perpetuate injustices related to the
   optimization of the currently dominant regime.},

Abstract = {Decarbonisation and innovation will change the affordability of
   different domestic energy services. This has the potential to alleviate
   vulnerability to fuel poverty, but it could create new injustices unless
   the risks are pre-empted and actively mitigated. In this paper, we ask:
   In what ways can emerging low-carbon innovations at the household scale
   complement, and complicate, achieving energy justice objectives? Drawing
   from four empirical case studies in the United Kingdom, the paper
   highlights different risks that come from different types of innovation
   required to tackle different decarbonisation challenges. More
   specifically, it assesses four particular household innovations-energy
   service contracts, electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels,
   and low carbon heating-selected for their fit with a typology of
   incremental vs. radical technology and modest vs. substantial changes in
   user practices. It shows how in each case, such innovations come with a
   collection of opportunities but also threats. In doing so, the paper
   seeks to unveil the ``political economy{''} of low-carbon innovations,
   identifying particular tensions alongside who wins and who loses, as
   well as the scope and temporality of those consequences.},

   justice implications of conventional energy systems (oil, gas, coal,
   etc.). Instead, we focus on the meaning of energy justice in the context
   of unconventional energy systems, by investigating small-scale bioenergy
   development in Nepal. We approach energy justice as a conceptual
   framework that focuses on social justice implications of energy systems,
   with an emphasis on burden/benefit distributions and procedural or
   post-distributive justice, and consider its applicability beyond
   conventional energy systems.
   Methods: Research was carried out in two parallel phases: (1) a
   quantitative phase, based on spatial analysis of secondary data,
   explores bioenergy distribution in Nepal, in relation to
   social-demographic characteristics, to investigate processes of
   distributive justice, and (2) a qualitative phase, based on thematic
   analysis of primary interview data, looks at post-distributive aspects
   of the energy reality in Nepal, to critically discuss the meaning of
   energy justice in this context.
   Results: 1) Biogas development is unevenly distributed, following
   patterns of social connectedness, which suggests significant spatial
   variation in capabilities or capability deprivations regarding
   individual agency in relation to (bio) energy.
   2) There is a surprising inconsistency in the relationship between
   socially marginalised populations and attainment of biogas across the
   country, which needs further research.
   3) Individual agency, supported or facilitated by enabling
   actors-particularly local biogas companies-is a key characteristic of
   local biogas development.
   4) Decentralised, small-scale energy development gives rise to power
   dynamics differing fundamentally from those of conventional centralised
   energy systems, through radically different processes of procedural
   justice.
   Conclusions: Processes of energy justice are shown to exhibit strong
   spatial variability and are associated with social connectedness.
   Analysis focusing on processes of agency and empowerment leads to the
   conclusion that energy justice, to encourage unconventional energy
   development, should emphasise the necessary interconnection of
   individual rights, empowerment and responsibility.},

Abstract = {Changes to the material and social systems that underpin energy
   infrastructures are inextricably linked to energy justice concerns, and
   the timeframes of those changes significantly affect their outcomes.
   Temporal aspects of energy initiatives and their impacts are thus an
   important site for examining emergent public views on new energy
   proposals, inequality, and energy justice. We propose urgency is a
   particularly rich concept through which to study (i) the justice and
   socioenvironmental implications of energy systems and technological
   change and (ii) how people make sense of contested energy timeframes.
   Here, we present findings from a series of public deliberation workshops
   held in the United States and United Kingdom to discuss projected
   impacts of shale oil and gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing. We
   encountered critical similarities across sites, as in widespread public
   resistance to issue framings that foreground urgency-based claims in
   support of their objectives. Participants assessed energy initiatives
   with particular reference to temporality and urgency, and we argue these
   views raise justice concerns regarding distribution, the creation of
   environmental inequalities, public participation, and recognition. We
   also suggest a focus on urgency provides fresh perspectives on justice
   issues surrounding the speed and direction of technological development
   in general and of energy transitions in particular.},

Title = {The identification and impact of justice risks to commercial risks in

Abstract = {The energy sector faces many challenges today, in particular from the
   current health (COVID-19) and resulting financial crises. However, a
   significant number of challenges existed prior to the outbreak of
   COVID-19. The approach here is to align academic and practitioner legal
   research and illuminate for the business world from a legal perspective
   what the key commercial risks are for the energy sector in the years
   ahead. A further aim of this article is to demonstrate to
   interdisciplinary energy researchers how these commercial risks can
   influence energy activity and decision-making across the world at local,
   national and international levels. Often those in science or social
   science do not realise the vital role law plays in reducing or
   increasing the risk profile of energy activity. And that, in essence, is
   what this article aims to address: the knowledge gap around law and risk
   and how interdisciplinary scholars should understand the issue of
   commercial risk in the energy sector. This article identifies how
   commercial risk for the energy sector will change due to what can be
   classed as `justice risks'. Resolving these justice risks will be
   necessary over the lifetime of a project from planning through
   construction, operation and decommissioning phases. For all stakeholders
   in the energy sector it is vital that there is a recovery and that new
   energy projects are built and that they contribute to a country's 2030
   energy and climate goals. As the world faces the ongoing challenges of
   the COVID-19, financial and energy-climate crises, ensuring engagement
   with justice risks can provide a pathway forward to ensure investors
   commit to investment. Energy, a key sector in the global economy, will
   be affected but at the same time can enable economic recovery. It can be
   stated, therefore, that energy has a dual nature - rather like the
   health sector - being part of the problem but also the solution to the
   current financial crises (ie the panacea).},

Abstract = {The transformation of the energy sector in Germany is associated with a
   considerable increase in prices, especially for electricity, which
   places different burdens on households depending on income. This
   conflicts with the idea of a fair distribution of burdens arising from
   the transformation of the energy sector and might endanger the
   acceptance of this transformation. For methodological reasons, we do not
   apply the GINI index in our analysis, instead we use the Atkinson index
   for the first time in the energy sector to quantitatively measure the
   distribution of energy consumption. Furthermore, we place the epsilon
   parameter of this index in the context of the discussion on sustainable
   development and justice. The epsilon parameter gives society the
   opportunity to make explicit what it implicitly considers to be
   ``just{''} and this concept can, if necessary, be corrected by a
   different choice of epsilon. If society chooses a higher epsilon value
   because it makes higher demands on a ``just{''} distribution of burdens
   and costs then the index can identify a gap between the normative goal
   and societal reality. This permits the authorities to implement economic
   policy measures to close this gap. From our point of view, the Atkinson
   index is an instrument that can be used to operationalize Rawls' theory
   of justice against the background of the social theory of sustainable
   development.
   For our analysis, we used the example of the burdens of transforming the
   energy sector in Germany. Our data basis is the German Household
   Expenditure Survey (EVS). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {At a time of great urgency for transitions to sustainability in light of
   climate mitigation targets, energy infrastructure is in a state of flux.
   Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels
   over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of
   socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy
   infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is
   burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological
   implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental
   and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities,
   and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address
   these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales -
   the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a
   variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human
   geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical
   transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three
   continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an
   array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars. It seeks
   to combine empirically rich and theoretically rigorous enquiry at the
   conjuncture of energy infrastructure transitions, changing land use and
   morphing social identity. The aim is thus to further interdisciplinary
   knowledge on socio-ecological implications of cross-sectoral
   transitions.},

Abstract = {This paper problematizes the uneven nature of low carbon energy
   transitions in the context of uneven geographical development and
   core/periphery asymmetries. It explores the impacts of transition for
   peripheral communities lacking political power and agglomerative
   advantages. While decentralised developments that emerge with energy
   transition promise to bring new opportunities to remote areas, factors
   of economic and political inequalities render those opportunities
   socially and spatially segregated. Exploring experiences of rural and
   exurban communities in South Wales, the paper establishes links between
   low carbon transition and its actually existing implications on the
   ground. It demonstrates that even if having an abundance of natural
   resource and physical space to harness low carbon energy, many rural
   communities are trapped in the chronic positions of energy
   peripheralization.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Addressing energy provision and access in Sub-Saharan Africa is a key
   global challenge. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders, this
   paper applies an energy justice framework in overviewing energy
   realities and policies in Malawi, where electricity access remains among
   the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The use of woodfuel remains high for
   meeting cooking, heating, and lighting needs leading to indoor air
   pollution, with serious health consequences, and widespread
   deforestation. Responses to these dual challenges, a lack of electricity
   access and ongoing woodfuel use, must be rooted in notions of equity,
   fairness, and justice. Application of energy justice theorising provides
   insights into how policy stakeholders are responding to complex and
   interconnected issues of energy generation and access in low-income
   settings. Overall, a just response to these energy challenges is
   possible, but only if it is built on local inclusive governance with
   fairer and effective systems of investment.},

Title = {Attributing responsibility for energy justice: A case study of the
   Hinkley Point Nuclear Complex},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {836-843},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since 2006, as part of the transition to low-carbon technologies, UK
   energy policy has moved towards incentivising new nuclear power
   production. As a result, the UK has developed a (now delayed) strategy
   to deliver around 16 GW of new nuclear power by 2030. This policy
   context provides an opportunity to reflect not only on the material
   infrastructure needed to meet transition targets, but also on who is
   responsible for the energy justice implications of these decisions.
   Using data collected from 26 semi-structured interviews with NGO and
   policy representatives, this paper presents a case study of energy
   justice concerns surrounding the Hinkley Point Nuclear Complex in
   Somerset, focusing particularly on the highly controversial Hinkley
   Point C developments. The results emphasise the importance of
   considering not only instances of energy justice or injustice, but of
   attributing responsibility for them, a concept that has been largely
   overlooked in the energy justice literature. NGOs, government and
   business allocate responsibility differently in nuclear energy decision
   making. We find that perceptions of responsibility are highly dependent
   upon the level of transparency in decision-making. This article is part
   of a Virtual Special Issue entitled `Exploring the Energy Justice
   Nexus'.},

Title = {Knowledge politics, vulnerability and recognition-based justice: Public
   participation in renewable energy transitions in India},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Public participation plays a crucial role in achieving Renewable Energy
   Transitions (RET). Existing research on energy transitions suggests that
   for seeking the active participation of all stakeholders, transition
   frameworks must be sensitive to the dynamic and complex interplay of
   power and agency. Knowledge politics that determine terms of engagement
   within energy transition projects often enable asymmetric agency
   resulting in vulnerability, exclusion and injustices. However, very
   little is known about how vulnerable and marginal groups resist
   subversion and re-define terms of engagement. This paper presents three
   cases of RET projects from India to engage with the interplay of
   knowledge politics, vulnerability and recognition-based energy justice.
   The cases bring comparable insights from RET projects on three different
   energy sources (second-generation bioethanol, advanced biogas and solar
   micro-grid), initiated by the government, industry and non-governmental
   actors in India. Based on the qualitative, empirical data gathered
   through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and
   ethnographic field observations, we argue that non-participation is a
   mode of resistance against subversive knowledge politics. Despite
   projected benefits and ``apparent needs{''}, people do not accept the
   predefined roles and identities prescribed for them in RET projects. In
   contrast, vulnerable and marginal social groups mobilize their agency by
   framing needs and priorities in relation to situated as well as emergent
   social, political and ecological identities and demand for
   recognition-based energy justice.},

   vertical complexity, horizontal complexity, higher entailed costs, and
   stronger path dependency. These structural attributes are at odds with
   contemporary key challenges of energy security, energy justice, and low
   carbon energy transition. With regard to the latter, energy governance
   challenges occur related to unclear levels of authority and weak

Abstract = {Low-carbon energy transition is a response to the dual challenges of
   climate change and sustainable development. Recent years have seen the
   emergence of the discourse of just energy transitions, which position
   social justice at the centre of energy transitions. Authoritarian
   regimes, because of the established tradition of command-and-control
   policy making, are considered a critical arena for advancing a just
   transition globally. A case review of low-carbon energy transitions
   worldwide reveals an important and significant knowledge gap on justice
   issues in more authoritarian regimes. Two in-depth case studies in China
   show that, although social injustice seems to be inevitable for energy
   transitions in authoritarian regimes, adaptive transition governance
   mainly through indirect participation mechanisms offers a pathway toward
   just energy transitions. The study calls for more nuanced and
   longer-term perspectives of social injustices that emerge in the process
   of energy transitions in authoritarian regimes.},

Title = {``Let justice roll down like waters{''}: Reconnecting energy justice to
   its roots in the civil rights movement},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The meaning and connotations of the word ``justice{''} as used in
   environmental justice and much climate justice literature were formed in
   the US civil rights movement. Its basic narrative is of a brutally
   oppressed people who took the initiative, defined their own needs,
   demanded freedom, co-opted the help of higher powers, and plagued their
   oppressors bravely and increasingly disruptively until the oppressors
   gave in. These connotations and meaning tend to cling to the word
   ``justice{''} when used in social-political reform movements of many
   kinds. Interestingly, today's energy justice literature shows a much
   wider spectrum of meaning of ``justice{''}. Much of this literature
   pursues an intellectual quest for the meaning of justice as an abstract
   imperative, which scholars investigate philosophically and apply to
   energy-related projects and transitions, to inform policymakers and
   others of the rights and wrongs of these, albeit often in relation to
   vulnerable or oppressed peoples. In this essay I trace the roots of the
   word ``justice{''} in the civil rights movement and its usage in the
   environmental and climate justice movements, and explore whether energy
   justice studies could benefit from a greater awareness of this. I also
   relate this justice narrative to the more basic question, raised by
   previous authors, of what it means to have moral values and make moral
   claims.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Active energy citizens are leading energy transitions, co-producing new
   cultures, practices and structures of production and consumption. This
   article aims to understand if prosumerism - the collective participation
   of prosumers in energy projects with social, economic and environmental
   benefits to society - can be referred to as a social movement. The
   article draws on a review of Social Movements Theory and applies
   thematic analysis to characterize 46 prosumer initiatives in Europe. The
   collective identities, socio-political opponents, knowledge-making
   activities, collective learning, and collective action aspects of these
   prosumers are described. The results show that prosumer initiatives
   converge towards a transformative social movement. This movement upholds
   decentralized renewable energy production and consumption, and presents
   itself as a socially inclusive, transparent and participatory energy
   model, replicable across the globe, in what can be described as a
   collective action towards a decentralized democratic energy model. The
   discussion highlights relationships between prosumerism and framings
   such as energy justice (including energy poverty and gender issues),
   energy democracy, climate change action and anti-nuclear movements, to
   reach a conclusion considering the relevance of calling prosumerism a
   social movement, while opening up some avenues for future research.},

Title = {Energy periphery: Uneven development and the precarious geographies of
   low-carbon transition},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {211},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The paper introduces the concept of energy periphery to interrogate
   place-based perspectives on the co-production of uneven geographical
   development, energy vulnerabilities and low carbon transitions. Energy
   periphery is defined as places that are systematically disadvantaged
   through the whole energy system due to their inferior position within
   the asymmetrical spatial distribution of economic, political and
   symbolic resources and capabilities. Within an energy periphery,
   energy-related factors are combined with other place-based conditions to
   subject their communities to a compound and circular effect of
   precarious energy experiences. The notion of energy periphery is
   underpinned by insights from the spatial justice, core-periphery and
   energy justice theories. Using the case of Wales, the paper demonstrates
   the multi-dimensional and multi-scalar character of energy
   peripheralisation, including political underrepresentation, the absence
   of economic agglomeration advantages, and dependence on off-grid fuels,
   energy inefficient homes and other `backward' technologies and
   practices. Social and spatial contingencies of energy vulnerability
   factors are outlined. Contrary to common discourses, energy transition
   further disadvantages energy peripheries and reproduces a fragmented
   socio-spatial landscape. The study overall demonstrates the importance
   of considering energo-socio-spatial relationships to better understand
   uneven energy transitions and social change more generally. (c) 2020

Title = {Nudging and boosting for equity? Towards a behavioural economics of
   energy justice},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With climate mitigation and energy transition impacts on vulnerable
   individuals becoming increasingly evident, justice considerations take
   on heightened relevance for energy governance. Yet, energy justice
   remains under-investigated in relation to the potential of behavioural
   economics. Behavioural economics provides evidence that individuals
   exhibit systematic and predictable patterns of decision-making that
   depart from the assumptions of rational choice theory, thus giving
   policy-makers a richer model of human behaviour. Adopting such a model
   will impact energy justice outcomes, hence understanding potential
   dynamics is timely. How can policy-makers complement traditional energy
   poverty alleviation measures with behaviourally informed ones to enhance
   vulnerable individuals' cognitive capacity? What implications does this
   carry for energy justice? Supportive choice architecture for individuals
   exposed to higher risks related to energy access and use must improve
   their outcomes, without shifting the responsibility for vulnerability to
   them, neglecting their intrinsic capabilities, or obscuring structural
   injustice. This article analytically illustrates whether and how
   behavioural economics can support individual behaviour and promote
   collective action, in combination with a policy shift to substantive
   claim-making processes, to address the unfair distribution of energy use
   burdens. Using nudging and boosting as tools for energy poverty
   alleviation, it discusses how behavioural economics can enhance energy
   justice.},

Title = {Can authoritarian regimes achieve just energy transition? Evidence from
   China's solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation initiative},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy justice is an important concept drawing attention to fairness and
   equity in the transition to clean energy. Recently, a theme that
   highlights procedural and distributive injustices of energy transition
   in authoritarian regimes, particularly China, has emerged in the
   literature. This study challenges this perspective with an examination
   of China's photovoltaic poverty alleviation initiative (PVPA)-a policy
   that aims to ease poverty through a clean energy transition in rural
   areas. The evidence collected from interviews and surveys shows that a
   just energy transition has been achieved by the PVPA in two ways. First,
   from a just procedure perspective, there are institutionalized
   mechanisms ensuring procedural justice, including public consultation
   conducted at the village level and the disclosure of information
   regarding the distribution of benefits. Second, from a just outcome
   perspective, the PVPA has made a positive material impact on poor rural
   households, and more broadly, village collectives. These findings show
   that just energy transitions in authoritarian regimes are possible, but
   they assume a path in which top-down politics, rather than bottom-up
   pressure, is the key driving force.},

Title = {The whole systems energy injustice of four European low-carbon
   transitions},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The need for multi-scalar analysis of energy and low-carbon systems is
   becoming more apparent as a way to assess the holistic socioeconomic and
   environmental impacts of energy transitions across a variety of scales
   and lifecycle stages. This paper conducts a whole systems energy justice
   analysis of four European low-carbon transitions-nuclear power in
   France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and
   solar photovoltaic panels in Germany. It asks: in what ways may each of
   these transitions result in injustices that extend beyond communities
   and countries, i.e., across the whole system? It utilizes a
   mixed-methods research design based on 64 semi-structured research
   interviews with experts across all four transitions, five public focus
   groups, and the collection of 58 comments from twelve public internet
   forums to answer this question. Drawing inductively from these data, the
   paper identifies and analyzes 44 injustices spread across three spatial
   scales. Micro scale injustices concern immediate local impacts on family
   livelihood, community health and the environment. Meso scale injustices
   include national-scale issues such as rising prices for electricity and
   gas or unequal access to low-carbon technology. Macro scale injustices
   include global issues such as the extraction of minerals and metals and
   the circulation of waste flows. The paper then discusses these
   collective injustices in terms of their spatiality and temporality,
   before offering conclusions for energy and climate research and policy.},

Abstract = {In this Perspective, we suggest that research on just transitions and
   energy justice needs to better attend to the increasingly important
   trade-offs arising from issues related to speed and acceleration of
   low-carbon transitions. We identify and elaborate two important tensions
   that policymakers face when they want to simultaneously achieve both
   just and rapid low-carbon transitions. First, the way in which
   participatory processes may increase justice but slow the speed of
   action; and second the way in which incumbent mobilization can
   accelerate transitions but entrench injustices. Such an analysis shifts
   the focus from mapping justice dimensions to acknowledging the
   inevitable trade-offs and winners and losers produced by transition
   processes as a first step to better navigating them.},

Title = {The spatial economics of energy justice: modelling the trade impacts of
   increased transport costs in a low carbon transition and the
   implications for UK regional inequality},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Spatial economic change is an energy justice issue (Bouzamvski and
   Simcock, 2017) - an essential consideration in how we choose to re-wire
   the economy for a carbon-free future. Nothing like the conscious
   system-wide change required has been attempted before. Rapid policy
   decisions risk embedding existing injustices or creating new ones unless
   steps are taken to ameliorate those risks. We present a model that takes
   a whole-system view of the UK spatial economy, examining how increasing
   distance costs (e.g. through fuel tax hikes) have unequal impacts on
   regions and sectors. The model establishes an important carbon
   transition policy principle: change in spatial flows of internal trade,
   which are certain to occur rapidly during transition, have measurable
   energy justice implications. Peripheral economic regions, in rural and
   coastal areas and many city outskirts are most vulnerable, as are
   petrochemical, agricultural and connected sectors. Policy must go beyond
   identifying places and sectors most affected: it is the connections
   between them that matter most. The ``push{''} of spatially aware fiscal
   policy needs to be combined with the ``pull{''} of targeted
   interventions designed to promote low-carbon intermediate connections.
   This is not only just, but would help make (potentially costly)
   transition more politically acceptable.},

Title = {Energy justice in the developing world: a review of theoretical
   frameworks, key research themes and policy implications},
Journal = {ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {122-138},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Energy justice, building on foundations within both the field of
   environmental justice and wider justice scholarship, has grown rapidly
   as a research field over recent years. However, the dominant energy
   justice theoretical frameworks, and many of the field's core case
   studies, originate from work in developed countries, with energy justice
   research only recently spreading to new areas of the world. This paper
   thus systematically reviews the current state of `developing economy'
   and `economy in transition' literature in the energy justice field. In
   doing this we analyse the (1) methods, energy types and locations
   explored thus far, unearthing key gaps, as well as (2) the multitude of
   `justice-led' theoretical frameworks used. We also identify core themes
   illuminated by energy justice research in the developingworld,
   including: (3) decentralisation, access and sustainability, (4) exposing
   institutional instability and corruption, (5) acknowledging marginalised
   communities and gender inequalities, while extracting key (6) policy
   implications. Vital questions are raised for the continued advancement
   of energy justice research into new contexts and thus its conceptual
   evolution. Our review highlights the potential for energy justice-led
   attention to expand current institutional, contextual and empirical
   scope in specific ways, including greater attention to the poorest
   global regions, and certain energy technologies including nuclear and
   CCS. We suggest four ways in which future theoretical developments of
   the field might take place: (i) greater attention to spatial analyses of
   neglected regions; (ii) expanding the field to further include
   nonwestern philosophical traditions; (iii) more work on applying tenets,
   frameworks and principles specific to energy justice and (iv) systems
   approaches to developed-developing country relations, with an emphasis
   on how they relate to low-carbon transitions. Thus, while we explore
   past and present applications of energy justice in developing world
   contexts, we also offer guidance on the ways in which it could be
   applied in the future, alongside encouraging dialogue between different
   `justice' fields. (C) 2020 International Energy Initiative. Published by

Abstract = {Smart technology alongside local energy systems are regularly considered
   critical for a low-carbon transition. More recently, a growing body of
   literature has started to examine the (in)justices that exist within
   energy systems and the impact this has on all people having equal access
   to safe, affordable, and sustainable energy. To date, little research
   has sought to synthesise the evidence base around whether smart local
   energy systems are an effective means of promoting energy justice. This
   paper presents a systematic literature review of 105 peerreviewed
   articles, with a focus on understanding the antecedents of energy
   justice in local energy systems and the role smart technology can play
   in mitigating these (in)justices. We propose an integrated framework
   outlining our findings and discuss the implications for a future

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of the energy justice framework notwithstanding,
   arguments offered have not been able to provide tangible definitions of
   sufficientarianism and energy mobility. Considering widening disparities
   on what constitutes sufficient energy (electricity) access between the
   global north (North America, Europe, Australia) and the global south
   (sub-Saharan Africa, SSA), this paper highlights the influence of
   `western reality' on the energy narrative. This paper also attempts to
   propose a model that evaluates off-grid electrification projects (in the
   global south) and their ability to guarantee sufficientarianism by
   examining the prospects of such projects in providing connected
   households access (energy security and sustainability of energy supply)
   and mobility (transition from a lower to higher energy level through the
   purchase of additional electrical equipment). Furthermore, this paper
   explores and provides arguments on energy bullying (by industrialized
   nations on developing countries mostly in SSA) while also offering
   suggestions for improvements in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
   projects. In essence, this paper formulates the endemic problems of
   energy access and energy mobility (plaguing the global south) as a
   justice problem and further provides insight into the exacerbation of
   injustice and bullying exhibited by the global north. Examples from
   South Africa have been utilized as case study.},

Pages = {517-528},
Abstract = {Scotland, like many other countries, is undergoing a transition to
   renewable energy. This paper discusses the social context within which
   this transition is taking place and which is conditioning the
   possibilities for energy development and its effects on people. In
   particular, the paper explores historically-rooted conflicts relating to
   land rights and wild land protection, considering these issues and their
   relationship to energy development in terms of landscape justice (i.e.
   the principle of fairness in the ways people relate to the landscape and
   to each other through the landscape). Pursuing a more just settlement
   between people and landscape is often a matter of understanding
   problematic pasts and working to overcome their harmful legacies. It is
   argued that there is an important role for heritage practice in helping
   to deliver energy development which takes the historical, social and
   cultural context more fully into account and thereby helps to bring
   about a more just settlement between people and the landscape.},

Abstract = {Persistent mismatches between problems, policy framings, and solutions
   point to unsettled ethical conundrums in the ways that the energy

   development is too often seen as the means to achieve more sustainable

   relationships between prosperity and sustainability. Second, while
   technological change is seen as essential to the transition, less
   attention is paid to the fact that disparities within societies demand
   differentiated solutions. Third, there are few principles in place for
   how to effect an energy transition with due attention to social justice
   in an unequal world. This article reflects on all three points.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite losing its low-carbon energy transition path in the last decade,
   Spain, since 2017, has picked up its commitment to complying with the
   objectives set out in the Paris Agreement for ratcheting 2030 and 2050
   ambitions. This research departs from an extensive in-depth expert
   stakeholder engagement, proposing a research process of scoping:
   reaching out to academics, NGOs, administrators, energy providers and
   the private sector among other agents that guide the future of
   transitions in Spain; listening: identifying, through interviews, the
   knowledge gaps; understanding: manifesting answers of the multitude of
   over 200 expert stakeholders and participating: extending out and
   disseminating results. We present five central emerging themes on:
   ambitions and temporalities of targets highlighting ambition gaps across
   stakeholder groups for 2030 and 2050 objectives; the future of carbon
   and nuclear energy pushing for eventual closure of both across distinct
   points in time; the rollout of renewable energy technologies in a
   transition pursuit; preferences on fiscal and policy measures to
   facilitate investments and priority sectors of action and ultimately
   discuss gender equality and justice, and the lack thereof, in energy
   decision making. Our research summons up the delicate intricacies of the
   transition debate in Spain, setting a discursive space in hopes of
   contributing to the future design of the Law on Climate Change and
   Energy Transition.},

Title = {Many shades of pink in the energy transition: Seeing women in energy
   extraction, production, distribution, and consumption},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The climate change crisis compels jurisdictions across the globe to
   decarbonize their energy systems, including by expanding the use of
   renewable energy. However, women are barely seen in this energy
   transition, and that gender blindness entrenches inequalities. This
   paper looks at women along the lifecycle of renewable energy from sites
   of extraction and generation to distribution and consumption. Based on
   eight published case studies from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin
   America, the study uses thematic analysis to examine: How are women
   exercising agency in different energy subsystems? And how does the
   transition in the various sub-systems affect women's lives in general,
   and gender equality in particular? The study documents that women mainly
   exert agency at local levels and remain marginal actors with limited
   decision-making authority. It also highlights contrasting women
   experiences along the renewable energy lifecycle, with cases of
   resistance and alliance to energy operations, and experiences of more or
   less meaningful participation. The paper stresses that addressing gender
   blindness in the energy transition requires more than switching energy
   sources and increasing the number of women employed in the energy
   sector. I suggest that women may use civil society fora to join forces,
   present their local experiences, and identify ways to challenge
   patriarchal energy decision-making and promote justice in the energy
   transition.},

Title = {Bringing geopolitics to energy transition research},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This perspective aims at a geopolitical conceptual and empirical
   contribution to research questions on power in energy transition
   research, coming from the history of energy and Sustainability
   Transitions Studies. It aims at answering the call that has been made
   for the development of approaches that take power dynamics between
   actors into account, by authors coming from Sustainability Transitions
   Studies.
   This article suggests a geopolitical approach of power relations, at and
   of the different scales of energy transitions - understood as a change
   of energy resource could open a complementary and more spatial vision on
   this issue based on the main concepts of representations,
   territoriality, and resource development.
   This conceptual proposition is then developed over two empirical
   examples. The first one is France's energy governance system, which is
   just stepping out of its precedent energy transition towards nuclear
   energy. It explores the effects of the ongoing sustainable transition on
   the structure of the political landscape and of the energy sector using
   the concepts of resource development control and appropriation. The
   second one on EU energy transition policy highlights the importance of
   representations, a key concept in geopolitics, whose analysis
   facilitates the understanding of actors' strategies.},

Abstract = {More than 70\% of the population in Ethiopia lack access to electricity
   and thus rely on conventional sources of energy such as biomass that is
   associated with negative consequences on health and the environment.
   Decentralized community-based micro-hydropower plants (MHPs) are being
   utilized as effective means to transition to modern low-carbon energy
   systems providing access to electricity to communities in remote areas.
   However, there exist a knowledge gap regarding energy justice dimensions
   and gendered impacts related to sustainable energy transitions in the
   Global South. This research investigates the gendered justice
   implications of low-carbon energy projects in the case of four
   community-based micro-hydropower projects in Ethiopia implemented by the
   German Development Cooperation (GIZ). Although the projects generally
   achieved positive outcomes for the lives of the villager's
   socio-economic impacts on income; productive use, health and education
   affected men and women differently. The particular energy needs, uses
   and challenges that women face were insufficiently addressed and hence
   are limiting the opportunities for women to benefit equally from access
   to electricity. Generally, procedural justice aspects such as access to
   information, consultation and participation seemed to be insufficient to
   create a sense of ownership which in turn can jeopardize the long-term
   sustainability of the hydropower plants.},

Title = {When democracy meets energy transitions: A typology of social power and
   energy system scale},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {159-168},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Societies need to transition to renewable energy and eliminate fossil
   fuel use as soon as possible. However, policymakers have mostly
   neglected to consider that there is an array of possible energy
   transition pathways. Therefore, I offer a typology that envisions
   potential energy futures as falling along a two-dimensional model
   comprised of the structural organization of the social (political,
   economic, and civil) on one axis - on a spectrum of democratic versus
   monopolistic - and the scale of the energy system on the other -
   dichotomized as centralized versus decentralized. This typology suggests
   that there are four potential energy futures, which I term: (1)
   libertarian energy decentralism, (2) technocratic energy centralism, (3)
   democratic energy centralism, and (4) democratic energy decentralism.
   These four futures are not equal in terms of power, equity, and
   ecological impact. I argue that the democratization of the social is
   necessary to facilitate a ``just transition,{''} but the scale of the
   energy system will also play a pivotal role in reinforcing and
   reproducing democratic and just social relations.},

Title = {Elite power in low-carbon transitions: A critical and interdisciplinary
   review},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states,
   and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the
   power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular,
   low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench
   the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography,
   political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among
   others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can
   exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by ``elite power.{''} It does so by
   offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of
   diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across
   a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both
   agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It
   then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship
   between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites,
   including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power
   frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power
   in low-carbon transitions-including the multi-level perspective, Michel
   Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other
   contextual approaches-before offering future research directions. The
   Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon
   transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better
   grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively,
   socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more
   desirable but also more possible.},

Title = {Acceptance of energy transitions and policies: Public conceptualisations
   of energy as a need and basic right in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {33-45},

Abstract = {Energy, and its use in society, can be understood and conceptualised in
   multiple different ways, emphasising different sets of values and
   attributes. In this paper, we examine how members of the public
   conceptualise energy, showing that a particularly salient frame is one
   of energy as a need and basic right. To orient our analysis we use the
   concept of framing, as rooted in sociological and psychological
   literature on framing effects and decision-making. The qualitative
   analysis draws from two UK datasets. The first consists of five focus
   groups (n=37) examining public perceptions of energy transitions. The
   second dataset consists of four deliberative workshops (n=46) exploring
   public perceptions of energy storage. We find that energy is explicitly
   discussed as a basic need because of its perceived role in ensuring
   survival, good health and a decent life. This is particularly salient
   when considering the wellbeing of vulnerable groups. We suggests that
   `energy as a need' provides a framework for people's evaluation of
   proposed changes to the wider energy system including how energy is
   produced, consumed and governed, and discuss implications for policy and
   practitioners that seek to ensure low-carbon energy transitions are
   successful, inclusive and socially acceptable.},

Title = {Decarbonization and its discontents: a critical energy justice
   perspective on four low-carbon transitions},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {155},
Number = {4},
Pages = {581-619},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because
   they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is
   evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and
   vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural
   drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With
   this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an
   unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a
   multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy,
   low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in
   this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon
   transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen
   social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed
   to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first
   elaborating an ``energy justice{''} framework consisting of four
   distinct dimensions-distributive justice (costs and benefits),
   procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global
   externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then
   examine four European low-carbon transitions-nuclear power in France,
   smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar
   energy in Germany-through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we
   draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews
   with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the
   monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct
   energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly
   recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions
   unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness
   invariably arise.},

Title = {Unpacking justice issues and tensions in transport system transition
   using multi-criteria mapping method},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper uncovers the (in)justices that arise from the three cases of
   ongoing transport system transition in the Philippines, namely the
   (non-)legitimation of motorcycle taxis, the formalization of jeepney and
   the implementation of high-priority bus system. These three cases are
   touted as potential transition pathways to sustainable mobility in the
   Philippines. Originally a method developed for the appraisal of
   contested visions, multi-criteria mapping (MCM) is used in this study to
   analyze interview data elicited from 17 stakeholders/specialists,
   representing a diversity of perspectives, through the five lenses of
   (in)justice (distributive, procedural, recognition, cosmopolitan and
   restorative). Just transition is understudied in the transportation
   literature, and this research identifies the equitable outcomes the
   three transition initiatives aim to achieve and the historical
   inequities they seek to remedy, but also, and more importantly, unpack
   injustice issues implicated in them which, being sources of tension,
   conflict and discontent, may powerfully resist the hoped-for sustainable
   transitions. The article ends with some policies, drawn from the cases
   that may ensure just transition for all.},

Title = {Solar energy justice: A case-study analysis of Saskatchewan, Canada},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Our study investigates solar energy justice in the province of
   Saskatchewan, Canada In 2017, we were engaged by the Saskatchewan Power
   Corporation (SaskPower), a government owned electric utility, to conduct
   stake-holder engagement workshops for the development of new solar
   energy programs in Saskatchewan. In coordination with SaskPower we
   developed a deliberative dialogue approach to the consultation process.
   Select stakeholders were invited to participate in a half-day workshop.
   In this workshop participants were asked for input on the principles
   that would guide SaskPower's solar energy strategy, the barriers that
   prevent solar energy from being installed in the province, and their
   ideas for effective solar energy programs. Participants worked in small
   groups to design solar energy programs, creating opportunities for
   mutual learning and deliberation. This research is the first application
   of deliberative dialogue to the design of solar energy programs of which
   we are aware and offers an example of due process in the program design
   stage of energy planning. We use an energy justice decision-making
   (Sovacool et al., 2014) tool to evaluate the process of designing
   SaskPower's solar energy strategy and the content of recommendations
   made by participants to answer the question, can due process help to
   achieve energy justice? Participants in our deliberative dialogue
   suggested guiding principles that were similar to the dimensions of the
   energy justice decision-making tool. The deliberative process also
   highlighted tensions between dimensions of the energy justice
   decision-making tool. In this paper, we suggest avenues to improve the
   deliberative dialogue process and conclude that centeringg due process
   as a core element of the energy justice decision-making tool can help to
   achieve energy justice. Our results contribute to the growing field of
   study on how deliberative dialogue can allow for better decisions in
   complex fields such as energy policy.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Renewable Energy (RE) is rapidly gaining relevance as a key technology
   to quench growing energy demand on the African continent. Many African
   states have introduced RE legislation, but the design of RE policy
   instruments, as well as their application and efficiency vary
   considerably across African economies. This article presents an analysis
   of energy transition processes based on a comparative mapping of African
   renewable energy policies in 34 countries. We discuss these developments
   with respect to their justice dimension, following up on the recent
   debate on distributive, recognitional, and procedural energy justice. We
   not only provide evidence of African energy policies covering
   recognitional and distributive justice, but also identify potential
   trade-offs between strong market orientation and justice concerns. We
   embed our findings in the debates on a ``just transition{''} and on
   ``energy justice{''} that have emerged as recent outcomes of the
   transition management literature travelling to the Global South.},

Title = {Injustices in phasing out nuclear power?: Exploring limited public
   participation and transparency in Taiwan's transition away from nuclear
   energy},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Transitions to non-nuclear energy systems are assumed to be positive
   phenomena. However, there is existing literature on how such transitions
   can result in new injustices. Since 2016, the government of Taiwan has
   promoted renewable energy and pursued the objective of establishing a
   nuclear-free homeland by 2025. Despite public enthusiasm for this green
   shift, there is a danger that concerns over accompanying environmental
   and energy injustices are being ignored. This paper addresses the gap
   between enthusiasm for environmental reforms and blindness to possible
   social consequences by applying procedural justice to an examination of
   the shift in energy policy in Taiwan. In 2018 and 2019, 45 interviews
   were conducted with relevant governmental entities, academics, industry,
   advocacy organisations (including pro- and anti-nuclear groups), and
   senior journalists, with the aim of shedding light on how Taiwan's
   energy transition and phasing out of nuclear energy by 2025 could both
   represent a commitment to environmental justice and yet result in the
   creation of new injustices. This research contributes to the wider
   debate on procedural injustices arising from transitions to non-nuclear
   energy sources. We emphasise the need to consider procedural justice in
   green transitions, and assert that doing so will help achieve the
   smoothest possible energy transition.},

Title = {Electrifying the `eighth continent': exploring the role of climate
   finance and its impact on energy justice and equality in Madagascar's

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Volume = {161},

Abstract = {Developing country case studies have thus far been under-represented in
   conceptual models attempting to theorize energy transitions. This paper
   explores the role of climate finance in the process of Madagascar's
   planned transition to renewable energy sources as envisioned in the
   country's New Energy Policy in order to demonstrate the different
   experience in developing countries when compared to hegemonic transition
   narratives. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with energy finance
   providers and focus groups in recently electrified rural communities,
   this paper reveals that Madagascar's transition is dependent on the
   financial resources mobilized by the government's technical and
   financial partners. Climate finance emerges as a critical lever to
   implement environmental legislation. The interview findings were
   correlated with census data to evaluate how current financing strategies
   are directly connected to energy justice issues, namely the equality in
   access to affordable and clean energy. Through an analysis of projected
   energy finance flows and key financiers' financing strategies, this
   paper exposes a shift from grant-based climate finance to financial
   instruments with clear return profiles, such as concessional loans and
   private capital, and finds that the choice of financial instrument
   impacts the provision of complementary social services in rural
   electrification schemes. Grants are linked to higher investments into
   complementary social services, while private financiers focus on
   innovation and scale. Purely private financed electrification projects
   were found to negatively impact social cohesion by increasing the
   inequality in access to energy. This study concludes that if only
   commercially viable energy projects were to be financed going forward,
   up to 19 million Madagascans might be excluded from future
   electrification efforts. Consequently, this paper urges researchers to
   consider social justice implications when evaluating climate finance
   strategies.},

Title = {Energy Justice as Part of the Acceptance of Wind Energy: An Analysis of
   Limburg in The Netherlands},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Policy documents in Limburg stress the importance of participation and
   distribution of benefits in wind energy projects, but it is not clear
   which modes of participation and distribution of benefits are most just,
   both in terms of perceived justice, and in terms of justice principles.
   Research shows that considering justice in renewable energy transitions
   increases the level of acceptance. This study aims to provide insight in
   what modes of participation and distribution are perceived as most just
   and likely to create local acceptance of wind parks. The most preferred
   modes are being compared to the indicators of the energy justice
   framework in order if they meet the criteria for a fair procedure and
   distribution of outcomes. Based on semi-structured interviews the
   analysis of the data demonstrated that different modes of participation
   in different phases of the process are being preferred and that a
   balance between modes of distribution of benefits is preferred. The
   results indicate that the most preferred modes of participation cannot
   necessarily address all indicators of procedural justice and that
   depending on the mode of distribution of benefits and the balance
   between those modes indicators of distributive justice can be addressed.},

Title = {Measurement of Fairness Perceptions in Energy Transition Research: A
   Factorial Survey Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Justice and fairness are increasingly popular concepts in energy
   research and comprise several justice dimensions, including distributive
   and procedural justice, related to energy production and consumption. In
   this paper, we used factorial survey experiments-a method employed in
   sociological justice research-for energy transition research. In a
   factorial survey, respondents evaluated one or more situations described
   by several attributes, which varied in their levels. The experimental
   setup of factorial surveys is one of its advantages over simple survey
   items, as based on this, the relative importance of each attribute for
   justice evaluations can be determined. We employed the method in a study
   on the perceived fairness of renewable energy expansion projects related
   to wind energy, solar energy, and biomass in Germany, and considered
   aspects of procedural and distributive justice. We show that the effects
   of these justice dimensions can be separated and the heterogeneity in
   justice evaluations can be explained. Compared to previous studies
   applying factorial survey experiments to explain the acceptance of
   renewable energy projects, we employed the method to directly measure
   justice concerns and asked respondents to evaluate the vignettes in
   terms of perceived fairness. This is important because acceptance and
   fairness as well as inequality and injustice are different phenomena.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an integrative literature review of representation
   of Indigenous peoples and knowledge in transitions scholarship. The aim
   of the review is to contribute to the broadening of the conceptual
   lenses used in transitions research and highlight emerging themes.
   Through an inductive latent content analysis, we identified five themes
   from the literature review: calls for more work, geography, justice,
   Indigenous-led, and governance and participation. Then we identified
   four emerging research directions: the phenomenon of ``epistemological
   superiority{''}, issues with research methods, relationships to systems,
   justice, and governance, and connection to land. We end the paper with
   an invitation for researchers to contribute to this area of research,
   and guidance for how we can broaden conceptual lens and respectfully
   include different perspectives in transitions research.},

Abstract = {Given the many problems with fossil energy, the fact that solar energy
   still only constitutes an insignificant fraction of global energy use
   requires explanation. The most common explanation is that multinational
   corporations with vested interests in fossil fuels have been actively
   preventing the development of solar energy technologies. But this
   explanation is difficult to apply to the case of Cuba. This article
   takes Cuban energy policy since the 1990s as a starting point to
   understand the sociometabolic prerequisites of a renewable energy
   transition. In 2014, Cuba embarked on a new renewable energy strategy
   while 95\% of the island's electricity was still generated from
   petroleum products. To explain Cuba's halting renewable energy
   transition, we demonstrate that modern energy technologies are always
   embedded in global flows of resources and processes of capital
   accumulation. The requisite investments of capital and labor in energy
   technology represent substantial, indirect land requirements beyond the
   space occupied by the technological infrastructure itself. The
   theoretical argument is that energy technologies should be perceived not
   simply as local, politically neutral accomplishments of engineering but
   as sociometabolic displacement strategies, appropriating space from
   elsewhere. From an interdisciplinary perspective, this means that
   assessments of a technology's ``power density{''} also need to consider
   the spatial demands of the global economic context that makes the
   technology feasible. The Cuban case illustrates how visions of a
   renewable energy transition in both mainstream and Marxist thought will
   need to be based on a radically transformed ontology of technology
   attentive to global political economy and energy justice. Ultimately,
   the global anticipation of a transition to renewable energy implicates
   illusory assumptions about ``technology{''} that have been taken for
   granted since the Industrial Revolution.},

Abstract = {Coupling innovations in everyday social and technological practices to
   close energy poverty delivers local sustainable development. Although
   case studies on the linkages between energy access and sustainable
   development had been far-reaching, we know very little about their
   interactions in everyday practices, such as cooking. A focus on access
   to renewable energy for everyday activities as cooking has substantial
   implications for the energy justice principles of equity, accessibility,
   and affordability. Energy justice underlines the necessity for all
   people to have access to energy services fairly. At the same time, one
   should ensure that these energy systems do not inflict damage upon the
   present and future generations. This paper used a Grounded Theory
   approach to show how an energy transition in everyday practices such as
   cooking can deliver just, local, sustainable development while emerging
   as a sociotechnical innovation in rural Thailand.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1135-1154},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Climate and labor movements clash over the need to keep fossil fuels in
   the ground versus protecting industrial jobs. In examining
   movement-countermovement dynamics in the coal transition in Germany, I
   analyze how labor and climate movements engage in discursive struggles
   about the meaning of justice in the just transition. In combining
   Gramscian theory with a narrative approach, my focus is on how labor and
   climate movements construct narratives around justice claims in the
   struggle over the hegemony of coal. In the case examined, claims about
   distributional, restorative, procedural and recognition justice are
   pitted against each other in jobs versus climate narratives. The results
   show that the inability to resolve the justice dilemma ultimately
   weakened counterhegemonic challenges and delayed the coal transition.
   This points to the need for transformative just transitions that bridge
   jobs versus climate divides and for a closer look at conflicts,
   contradictions and tensions in just transitions.},

Title = {A matter of metrics? How analysing per capita energy use changes the
   face of energy efficient housing in Sweden and reveals injustices in the
   energy transition},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Improving energy performance of the housing stock continues to be an
   important undertaking in the energy transition of many EU member states.
   However, tendencies of low-income households generally living in
   buildings with low energy performance pose a challenge for this
   transition, and cases of `renoviction' and `green gentrification' are
   becoming more and more noticed in the scientific community. More so,
   questions regarding the distributive justice of costs and burdens in the
   energy transition of the housing stock have been raised. In this paper,
   we approach this problem from a perspective of energy performance
   metrics. Although energy performance (kWh/m(2), year) is generally lower
   in buildings inhabited by low-income households, residential density-and
   thus building utilisation-tends to be higher. By measuring per capita
   energy use instead of area normalised energy use, we investigate if a
   high residential density can offset a low energy performance and change
   the perception of which buildings are considered energy inefficient and
   which are not. Results showed that by measuring per capita energy use
   instead of area-normalised energy use, energy inefficient buildings were
   found in high-income city centres instead of in low-income suburbs of
   Swedish cities. Moreover, there has been an unjust distribution of the
   imposition of the energy transition over the past decade where the
   residents with the initially lowest per capita energy use have carried a
   disproportionately high share of the energy savings. This suggests that
   a change of energy performance metrics could offer an approach for a
   more socially just and sustainable energy transition of the housing
   stock.},

Title = {Energy Justice and Smart Grid Systems: Evidence from the Netherlands and
   the United Kingdom},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {229},
Pages = {1244-1259},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Smart grid systems are considered as key enablers in the transition to
   more sustainable energy systems. However, debates reflect concerns that
   they affect social and moral values such as privacy and justice. The
   energy justice framework has been proposed as a lens to evaluate social
   and moral aspects of changes in energy systems. This paper seeks to
   investigate this proposition for smart grid systems by exploring the
   public debates in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Findings show
   that smart grids have the potential to effectively address justice
   issues, for example by facilitating small-scale electricity generation
   and transparent and reliable billing. It is a matter of debate, however,
   whether current smart grid designs contribute to cost and energy
   savings, advance a more equitable and democratic energy system, or
   reinforce distributive and procedural injustices. The increased use of
   information and communication technology raises value conflicts on
   privacy and cyber security, which are related to energy justice. This
   research contributes by conceptualizing energy justice in the context of
   smart grids for the first time. The energy justice framework is
   broadened by including values and value conflicts that pertain directly
   to the increased use of information and communication technology. For
   policy makers and designers of smart grids, the paper provides guidance
   for considering interconnected social and moral values in the design of
   policies and smart grid technologies.},

Title = {Contextualizing the Covid-19 pandemic for a carbon-constrained world:
   Insights for sustainability transitions, energy justice, and research
   methodology},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The global Covid-19 pandemic has rapidly overwhelmed our societies,
   shocked the global economy and overburdened struggling health care
   systems and other social institutions around the world. While such
   impacts of Covid-19 are becoming clearer, the implications of the
   disease for energy and climate policy are more prosaic. This Special
   Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between
   Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future
   low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of
   research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What
   are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and
   climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and
   varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the
   disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability
   transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How
   might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying
   patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice?
   Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the
   practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that
   without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by
   Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus
   packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that
   exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices,
   and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.},

Title = {The justice and equity implications of the clean energy transition},
Journal = {NATURE ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Pages = {569-577},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The transition to lower-carbon sources of energy will inevitably produce
   and, in many cases, perpetuate pre-existing sets of winners and losers.
   The winners are those that will benefit from cleaner sources of energy,
   reduced emissions from the removal of fossil fuels, and the employment
   and innovation opportunities that accompany this transition. The losers
   are those that will bear the burdens, or lack access to the
   opportunities. Here we review the current state of understanding-based
   on a rapidly growing body of academic and policy literature-about the
   potential adverse consequences of the energy transition for specific
   communities and socio-economic groups on the frontlines of the
   transition. We review evidence about just transition policies and
   programmes, primarily from cases in the Global North, and draw
   conclusions about what insights are still needed to understand the
   justice and equity dimensions of the transition, and to ensure that no
   one is left behind.
   The costs and benefits of clean energy transitions will not be equally
   distributed. This Review of the literature on potential adverse impacts
   for specific communities highlights opportunities for future research to
   contribute to the design of policies and programmes that address these
   disparities.},

Title = {From framework to boundary object? Reviewing gaps and critical trends in
   global energy justice research},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The concept of energy justice (EJ) has gained importance in discussions
   about energy transitions, mainly due to a growing number of researchers
   working on the social implications of greenhouse gas emission
   reductions. At the moment, EJ is defined as a framework for discussing
   fairness in energy systems and operates as an umbrella term to signify
   various concerns related to energy development across diverse groups to
   enable communication. Thus, we call EJ a boundary object (BO) and
   discuss its further evolution into a standard, or its dissolution into
   several locally specific concepts. This study provides a systematic
   review of the literature that applies the concept of EJ: how its
   features developed and how it gained popularity in academic publications
   to mid-2019. We present a bibliometric overview of the number of
   occurrences of the concept across the literature using the Scopus and
   WOS databases (N = 182) and, using VOSviewer software, we describe
   similarities between research topics to which the concept was related.
   By mapping out its diverse thematic and geographic applications, we
   review the critical trends and claim that EJ can address real-life
   challenges. We submit that it will have more practical power once it
   starts being used more broadly to build cooperation among scholars,
   policymakers, activists, and grassroots movements.},

Title = {Contested renewable energy projects in Latin America: bridging
   frameworks of justice to understand `triple inequalities of
   decarbonisation policies'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {Renewable energy (RE) projects are increasingly contested. We present
   bio- and wind energy projects in Argentina, Mexico, and Nicaragua with
   reference to different frameworks of justice. We bridge the concept of
   energy justice with insights from climate change and climate justice
   research and argue that the social groups facing energy injustices
   related to the implementation of RE projects face a situation of `triple
   inequalities of decarbonisation policies': they are negatively affected
   by climate change although, from a global and historical perspective,
   they have not contributed much to it, and now face injustices related to
   the mitigation of climate change. We underscore this argument by
   presenting cases of wind energy generation and biomass production for
   fuel. We conclude that relating different strands of justice debates
   with a historically grounded analysis of triple inequalities can imply
   the denial of RE projects by actors who belong to marginalised groups -
   despite of a global urgency of decarbonisation.},

   transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {35-48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy democracy is an emergent social movement advancing renewable
   energy transitions by resisting the fossil-fuel-dominant energy agenda
   while reclaiming and democratically restructuring energy regimes. By
   integrating technological change with the potential for socioeconomic
   and political change, the movement links social justice and equity with
   energy innovation. Through a policy mix lens, this research examines the
   energy democracy agenda in the United States to understand how and to
   what extent the mix of policy instruments currently proposed among
   energy democracy advocates corresponds to the overarching goals of the
   movement. This assessment compares 22 policy instruments to 26 intended
   outcomes for energy democracy. The mix of policy instruments holds
   potential for advancing renewable energy transitions based on the
   combined goals of resist-reclaim-restructure, although current policies
   relate unevenly across the set of intended outcomes. Bolstering the
   energy democracy agenda will likely require developing new policies,
   strengthening existing policies, and integrating efforts to
   simultaneously resist dominant energy systems while also supporting
   their democratic and inclusive replacement. This research increases the
   visibility of the energy democracy movement and clarifies and assesses
   the core claims and policy instruments advanced by its advocates,
   contributing to policy design for renewable energy transitions and
   energy democracy.},

Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {236},
Pages = {211-219},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {As our energy systems are transitioning towards low-carbon energy
   sources and their environmental and economic sustainability are
   assessed, their potential social impacts must also be determined. These
   social impacts may be disproportionate to a population, leading to
   energy justice concerns. The social life cycle assessment framework can
   be used to comprehensively address energy justice concerns by different
   stakeholder groups and at all life cycle stages associated with a
   low-carbon energy system. Indicators for a social life cycle assessment
   framework that addresses energy justice are introduced and discussed.
   These indicators are organized by four categories of stakeholders for
   electrical energy systems: workers, electricity consumers, local
   communities, and society as a whole. The social life cycle assessment
   framework allows for variations in justice and equity to be determined
   not only at the generation stage, but through multiple points in the
   life cycle of the same energy system, from raw material extraction,
   through manufacturing, transportation, distribution, electricity
   generation, and waste management. This framework can address potential
   energy justice issues along the life cycle of new energy systems and
   assist in their design and planning for optimizing their social
   sustainability without overlooking vulnerable populations.},

Title = {National Energy Transition Framework toward SDG7 with Legal Reforms and
   Policy Bundles: The Case of Taiwan and Its Comparison with Japan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The main problem explored in this study is how Taiwan and other
   countries meet the challenges of the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals regarding energy transition by using legal instruments
   or policy bundles. This study adopts textual analysis and legal policy
   analysis as its main form of research methodology, and the theory of
   energy justice, as well as principles of energy management, to correlate
   with the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, this study aims to
   construct an analysis structure for national energy transition and to
   analyze the current situation within Taiwan's electricity sector
   reforms, while providing evidence of the national experience of
   electrical industry reforms as an international reference. This study
   also compares the differences between the seventh Sustainable
   Development Goal relationship and national energy transitions in Taiwan
   and Japan, based on the similar initiative of the revised Electricity
   Act with the policy bundle. This study specifically finds that, firstly,
   the theory for energy justice is connected with the principles for
   energy management, owing to the same concepts of ``Fair Competition{''},
   via the recognition of ``Energy Development and Poverty{''}, which
   correlates with ``Environment Protection{''}. Therefore, the concept of
   energy transition proposed in this study integrates national energy
   development policy goals and combines them with environmental
   sustainability, the green economy, and social equity. Secondly, the
   national energy transition in Taiwan is a response to the Sustainable
   Development Goals, and electricity sector-related laws could be used as
   legal tools for national energy transition. This study concludes that
   Taiwanese and Japanese governments can strengthen their environmental
   regulations to promote fair competition directly, with fair competition
   then being able to enhance stable electricity supply, to enable these
   countries to move towards the seventh Sustainable Development Goal and
   its indicators. Finally, the analysis structure used in this study could
   be used as a policy analysis tool for other countries during their own
   energy transition, when a nation is willing to strategically reform its
   electricity sector and make sustainable choices regarding transition
   paths and policy bundles that are suitable for the situation of the
   individual country. Then, a nation can make revisions to its laws and
   formulate a policy that is in line with local conditions, while as
   simultaneously implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.},

Title = {Energy justice in Japan's energy transition: pillars of just 2050 carbon
   neutrality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW \& BUSINESS},
Abstract = {Energy justice is a topic that is currently being explored by energy law
   experts around the world and used across several academic fields in
   energy research. However, we note that this concept is quite novel in
   Japan (there have been no substantial publications published in either
   English or Japanese) and could be expanded. This is especially important
   in light of Japan's aspirations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and
   implement a just energy transition. In this context, the article's goal
   is to present the energy justice theory in a legal (energy law) and
   policy (climate-energy policy) framework in Japan. The article discusses
   the five basic types of justice, referring to Japanese energy
   legislation and climate-energy policy as examples. The analysis includes
   an assessment of the carbon neutrality pillars (seen through the prism
   of energy justice theory), aimed at supporting Japan in meeting its
   climate targets, and directions related to the use of renewable,
   conventional and nuclear energy sources requiring examination in terms
   of energy justice (due to failures of energy policy, such as lack of
   stakeholder recognition, local conflicts, NIMBY, etc.). Furthermore, the
   article demonstrates the improvements required in the legal and policy
   frameworks in Japan to make the application of human rights and the
   Sustainable Development Goals across the energy life-cycle effective.
   This will also include an examination of potential legal and
   organisational changes, and new structures and appointments in the
   Japanese administration.},

Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {226},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the literature on energy justice by
   revealing how the principles of energy (in)justice manifest at the
   domestic scale. We use data from a retrofit intervention trial to reveal
   recognised and hidden vulnerabilities and practiced distributive and
   procedural energy fairness in the lived experiences of low-income older
   and/or frail householders near Melbourne, Australia. Combining the
   capability and practice approach for the transition to lower carbon
   housing to provide a rich description, we chart householder functionings
   of heating and paying energy bills and their choices in keeping warm and
   affording energy before and after simple retrofits. Energy justice was
   experienced on four separately distinguishable levels of social
   relationships: intrahouseholds, household-energy retailer relations,
   immediate social networks and wider social relations. The outcomes of
   the trial showed that combinations of simple retrofits improved
   householder heating capabilities. Policies and programs aimed at
   transitioning to low-carbon energy systems need to acknowledge and
   address the changing demand for energy of an ageing population, and
   acknowledge social differentiation within households. This includes
   using a capabilities approach to recognising multiple vulnerabilities.},

Title = {Is the just transition socially accepted? Energy history, place, and
   support for coal and solar in Illinois, Texas, and Vermont},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Given a myriad of challenges and technological advancement, the energy
   system has been constantly evolving and transforming, which requires
   compatible adjustments in energy policies. For regions with highly
   diverse energy sources, such as the United States, its important to not
   only analyze public perceptions of various energy sources, but also
   examine relative levels of support for energy transition policies. We
   examine public perceptions of two energy sources, coal and solar energy,
   as well as the public's support for energy transition policies that
   assist the transition from coal to renewable energy, specifically solar.
   To better understand how place influences attitudes and policies of coal
   and solar, we sampled respondents from three areas with varying ties to
   coal and solar: Saline County, IL, Houston, TX, and Burlington, VT. Our
   results suggest that one's place has an important effect in
   differentiating the public perceptions of renewable and nonrenewable
   energy and for support in an energy transition from fossil fuels to
   renewable energy. While residents of places with historical attachment
   to coal mining have positive attitudes toward coal, our data show that
   they have even more positive attitudes toward sustainable energy
   sources. These attitudes hold for future development and government
   assistance. If federal or state governments seek to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions (and consequently energy from coal, a major source of
   greenhouse gases), solar and other sustainable energy policies need to
   be targeted at places with historical ties to coal and other fossil
   fuels to ensure a procedurally just energy transition.},

Title = {Just cuts for fossil fuels? Supply-side carbon constraints and energy
   transition},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1072-1092},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions has generally been approached through
   demand-side initiatives, yet there are increasing calls for supply-side
   interventions to curtail fossil fuel production. Pursuing energy
   transition through supply-side constraints would have major geopolitical
   and economic consequences. Depending on the criteria and instruments
   applied, supply cuts for fossil fuels could drastically reduce and
   reorient major financial flows and reshape the spatiality of energy
   production and consumption. Building on debates about just transitions
   and supply constraints, we provide a survey of emerging interventions
   targeting the supply of, rather than the demand for, fossil fuels. We
   articulate four theories of justice and criteria to prioritize cuts
   among fossil fuel producers, including with regard to carbon intensity,
   production costs, affordability, developmental efficiency and support
   for climate change action. We then examine seven major supply constraint
   instruments, their effectiveness and possible pathways to supply cuts in
   the coal, oil and gas sectors. We suggest that supply cuts both reflect
   and offer purposeful political spaces of interventions towards a `just'
   transition away from fossil fuel production.},

Title = {Talk renewables, walk coal: The paradox of India's energy transition},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coal is on the rise in India: despite the devasting impacts of the
   climate crisis, the awareness for land and forest rights, and political
   talk of a coal phase-out. In this article, we demonstrate that despite
   the renewables-led rhetoric, India is in the midst of a transition to
   (not away from) greater use of coal in its fossil energy system and in
   the electricity system in particular. We investigate this paradox by
   combining socio-metabolic and political ecological analysis of the
   Indian coal complex. Our framework integrates material and energy flow
   data as characterizing the Indian fossil energy transition, indicators
   on the development and structure of the coal industry, and studies of
   ecological distribution conflicts around coal. The dominant claim to
   expansive use of coal and the competing counterclaims are indicative of
   underlying power relations which can also be witnessed in other
   countries. In India, they extend into the conflicted development of
   renewable energy including hydropower, in which the land dispossession,
   exclusion, and injustices associated with the expansion of the coal
   complex are reproduced. We conclude that the current energy transition -
   in which coal continues to play a dominant role - is neither sustainable
   nor just.},

   just transition discourses},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {329-339},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Hunter Valley, in New South Wales, Australia, is a globally
   significant coal mining and exporting region. The Hunter economy's
   strong basis in fossil fuel production and consumption is challenged by
   civil society campaigns employing environmental justice discourses. This
   paper analyses how two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region
   ('Stop T4' and `Groundswell') have countered the regional hegemony of
   fossil fuel interests from an environmental justice perspective.
   However, the discursive dominance of the jobs versus environment' frame
   hinders efforts to build solidarity amongst local environmental justice
   goals on the one hand, and workers and union aspirations for secure,
   quality jobs on the other. Long-term structural decline of global coal
   markets adds pressure for economic transition. We argue that campaigns
   to open up possibilities for transition away from fossil fuel dependency
   to a post carbon society can be strengthened by engaging with the `just
   transition' discourses that are typically associated with organised
   labour. Doing so can create synergy for social change by aligning
   community and labour movement interests. Inclusive social movement
   partnerships around this synergy must address structural disadvantage
   that creates social and economic insecurity if communities are to
   prevail over the fossil fuel sector's hegemony. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   Analysis},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Within the context of an energy transition towards achieving a renewable
   low-impact energy consumption system, this study analyses how bottom-up
   initiatives can contribute to state driven top-down efforts to achieve
   the sustainability related goals of (1) reducing total primary energy
   consumption; (2) reducing residential electricity and heat consumption;
   and (3) increasing generated renewable energy and even attaining
   self-sufficiency. After identifying the three most cited German
   bottom-up energy transition cases, the initiatives have been
   qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The case study methodology
   has been used and each initiative has been examined in order to assess
   and compare these with the German national panorama. The novel results
   of the analysis demonstrate the remarkable effects of communal living,
   cooperative investment and participatory processes on the creation of a
   new sustainable energy system. The study supports the claim that
   bottom-up initiatives could also contribute to energy sustainability
   goals together within the state driven plans. Furthermore, the research
   proves that the analysed bottom-up transitions are not only
   environmentally and socially beneficial but they can also be
   economically feasible, at least in a small scale, such as the current
   German national top-down energy policy panorama.},

Title = {Towards a Just Energy Transition, Barriers and Opportunities for
   Positive Energy District Creation in Spain},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To mitigate the effects of climate change, the European Commission
   created a Strategic Energy Technology Plan committing to forming 100
   Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) by 2025. These are considered to
   potentially be major instruments for decarbonization in a just
   transition. This plan has led to some districts being defined as PEDs,
   although none have fully met the criteria to be a PED yet. Research
   shows that new forms of energy ownership and production, as could
   potentially be found in PEDs, could help reduce energy poverty, which
   affects a significant segment of the population, as households can
   reduce their energy expenditure as well as improve their energy
   behavior. This paper set out to shed light on the PED landscape,
   investigating the barriers and opportunities to PED creation in Spain
   and its potential to mitigate energy poverty. We conducted a literature
   review on community-owned energy in Spain, followed with expert
   interviews (energy researchers, stakeholders, and NGOs) who focus on
   sustainability issues in Spain. Results show a number of barriers (lack
   of knowledge and awareness, and lack of trust from consumers) and
   opportunities connected with the creation of PEDs. In conclusion,
   policymaker engagement and support play a key role in successfully
   implementing PEDs.},

Abstract = {Much research on electric mobility transitions has been descriptive or
   positive, rather than normative or critical, assessing the deeper
   ethical, justice, or moral issues that arise. To address this gap, this
   study qualitatively examines the ongoing transition to Nordic electric
   vehicles (EVs) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. It does so through the
   various lenses of distributive justice, procedural justice, cosmopolitan
   justice, and recognition justice. It asks: what are the types of
   injustices associated with electric mobility and V2G? In what ways do
   emerging patterns of electric mobility worsen socio-environmental risks
   or vulnerabilities? Based on original primary data collected from 257
   experts across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, the study
   fords that electric mobility can erode elements of distributive justice
   for being accessible only to the rich, and for raising risks related to
   privacy, hacking, and cyberterrorism. Electric mobility may contravene
   aspects of procedural justice by reinforcing exclusion and elitism in
   national planning. It can erode cosmopolitan justice by producing
   negative environmental externalities, and exacerbating rural (and
   global) vulnerability. It may threaten recognition justice through
   unemployment, disruption to traditional businesses, and the entrenchment
   of patriarchy. Thankfully, the study also proposes a suite of policy
   mechanisms to address many of these concerns.},

Title = {Community acceptability and the energy transition: a citizens'
   perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Background Every energy transition has had its winners and its losers,
   both economically and in terms of social justice and community cohesion.
   The current transition is no different given the complex, intersecting
   matrices of power and experience that influence the key stakeholders and
   actors involved. Local oppositions to the deployment of renewable energy
   technologies have been significantly higher than expected. In numerous
   instances, these oppositions have been in reaction to the disempowerment
   of local rights and entitlements associated with specific developments.
   Consequently, there is a clear need for governance structures and
   organisational formats that are participatory, inclusive and mindful of
   the lived experiences of local people. Despite the knowledge gaps and
   financial constraints that continue to persist, how can local
   communities become empowered to drive project development and
   meaningfully engage in the low-carbon energy transition? Methods This
   paper presents a methodology for investigating citizen perceptions of
   the energy transition and the kinds of roles they see themselves having
   in its implementation. Working with six communities across five European
   countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK), we conducted a
   series of iterative cross-sectional community engagements using a mixed
   methods approach. In addition, a number of innovative participatory
   action research tools were incorporated to engage citizens in
   co-designing their own energy transition pathways. Results Participants
   expressed having restricted agency as citizens participating in the
   energy system. They also felt locked in to a limiting set of false
   choices as `energy consumers' that do not translate into real or
   meaningful power, despite popular narratives to the contrary. The
   research also resulted in a co-designed characterisation tool to help
   local communities assess the energy democracy and citizen participation
   potential of a number of participatory business models. Conclusions
   Citizens remain locked out of the decision-making processes of the
   energy transition. We outline a more integrated approach, using
   co-design and participatory action research, to incorporate citizen
   perspectives into the planning and implementation of more appropriate
   business configurations. This paper presents demonstrable examples of
   how extended stakeholder perspectives can improve procedural justice
   outcomes and ensure the rollout of more equitable energy configurations
   into the future.},

   of the nuclear phase-out in Germany},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {289-298},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The nuclear melt-down in Fukushima resulted in diverging energy policy
   decisions across the world where Germany decided to opt out of nuclear
   electricity production. Yet, the government's decision-making framework
   for energy policy decisions does not accurately reflect important
   drivers for the strategy change. This paper presents the Energy
   Crossroads framework as a more comprehensive tool to analyse the drivers
   and impacts of the nuclear phase-out. 20 expert interviews were
   performed across business participants as well as policy makers in the
   national and international energy context. Results show that Germany has
   adopted an environmental justice, rather than energy security, stance in
   their nuclear phase out policy, with significant long-term consequences.

Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {855-863},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is a fundamental objective to transition towards a low-carbon economy
   worldwide which is supported by an international legal agreement - the
   2015 Paris Agreement. In order to achieve this ambition, there is a need
   for new and more mineral extraction which is necessary for the
   technology for this low-carbon transition. These minerals are known as
   critical minerals and this article examines the role of justice needed
   in their development. The literature to-date lacks any holistic yet
   focused examination of the key elements of justice in the development of
   this industry. This conceptual article makes an original contribution
   that utilises an interdisciplinary perspective, legal geography, and
   explores key issues of justice that include distributive, procedural,
   restorative, recognition and cosmopolitan. The research identifies the
   key questions that need to be resolved under each element of justice and
   the unfortunate limited timeframes for action. Critical justice areas
   include taxation, environmental impact assessments, waste management,
   social license to operate, and cross-border actions. Resolving these
   issues will directly address societal issues of inequality and ensure a
   just transition to a low-carbon economy. Already there is a global race
   for critical minerals, and justice needs a stronger role in its
   development based on evidence to-date.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the wake of the Paris Agreement on climate change, promises to phase
   out coal-fired power have suggested cause for optimism around energy
   transition globally. However, coal remains entangled with contentious
   development agendas in many parts of the world, while fossil fuel
   industries continue to flourish. This article discusses these
   entanglements through a climate justice lens that engages the cultural
   politics surrounding coal and energy transition. We highlight how recent
   struggles around phasing out coal have stimulated renewed critical
   debates around colonialism, empire, and capitalism more broadly,
   recognizing climate change as an intersectional issue encompassing
   racial, gender, and economic justice. With social movements locked in
   struggles to resist the development or expansion of coal mines, power
   plants, and associated infrastructure, we unpack tensions that emerge as
   transnational alliances connect disparate communities across the world.
   Our conclusion signals the need for greater critical engagement with how
   intersecting inequalities are coded into the cultural politics of coal,
   and how this shapes efforts to pursue a just transition.},

Title = {Balancing cost and justice concerns in the energy transition: comparing
   coal phase-out policies in Germany and the UK},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Abstract = {Europe's two largest economies - Germany and the UK - are phasing out
   coal from electricity production as part of European efforts to fulfil
   increased climate policy ambitions that require comprehensive energy
   system transitions. German and UK governments varied in the ways they
   sought support from diverse societal interests to make the transition
   socially acceptable and politically feasible. Drawing on 22 expert
   interviews and process-tracing methods, this paper compares and explains
   how political and economic institutional differences influenced efforts
   to balance energy transition concerns, like speed and cost-effectiveness
   with justice for companies, workers and communities most adversely
   affected by the transition. We find that the increasing attention to
   just transition perspectives after the Paris Agreement affected the
   design of coal phase-out processes in different ways in the two
   countries. Just transition concerns were given priority by policymakers
   in Germany, but more so if they overlapped with the interests of
   incumbents. In the end, politically powerful stakeholders dominated the
   policy outcome. In the UK, policymakers and stakeholders gave only weak
   attention to just transition concerns, mainly because coal's market
   position had collapsed. Coal interests did not have strong
   representation in the decision-making process. But we find that just
   transition concerns are likely to gain more attention in the UK because
   a more challenging transition away from gas will take place over the
   next two decades. Key policy insights Policymakers must balance the
   objective of a fast decarbonization process against two other important
   concerns: cost-effectiveness and a just transition. Political-economic
   institutional design and capacity shape the extent to which just
   transition concerns are given weight in coal phase-out processes. State
   capacity for including just transition concerns in coal phase-out
   processes is higher when political and economic institutions strongly
   mediate government-stakeholder interaction in the policy process, and
   broad stakeholder participation increases the political feasibility and
   legitimacy of policy change. In Germany, the government's attention to
   just transition concerns was strong because broad stakeholder
   representation in the formal process, and transition assistance policies
   to target potential losers in the transition, became crucial to enhance
   the legitimacy of coal phase-out policies. In the UK, cost-effectiveness
   trumped just transition concerns in the coal phase-out process, but just
   transition issues have increasing salience and will likely become
   pertinent in the upcoming gas phase-out process because more jobs and
   key economic interests are at stake. Our findings are relevant for
   policymakers in countries struggling with balancing speed,
   cost-effectiveness and just transition concerns in similar transition
   processes: phasing out coal, gas, or oil from their energy system. The
   findings may also inform future energy transition research.},

Title = {What shapes Norwegian wind power policy? Analysing the constructing
   forces of policymaking and emerging questions of energy justice},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper employs an assemblage theoretical approach to analyse how
   Norwegian land-based wind power policies are constructed over time and
   what forces dominate and resist wind power policy development. The
   entanglement of policies, technology deployment and (lack of) social
   acceptance emphasizes the need to critically question what and who
   influence the construction of energy transition policies and how and
   what concerns are left out, especially in relation to the tenets of
   energy justice. We find that wind power policies are primarily
   influenced by energy authorities, developers and interest organizations,
   furthering arguments of climate concerns, energy security and economic
   opportunity. The emerging voices of local governments, environmental
   organizations and concerned citizens claim new political engagement
   related to valuations of (local) environmental, distributional and
   procedural justice and the recognition of alternative future energy
   imaginaries. The increase in conflicts and public debates has challenged
   national politicians to play a more active role in wind power policy
   making, which entails the reconsideration of wind power as an energy
   policy and critically judging what, for whom and how wind power should
   contribute to local, national and global energy transitions.},

Abstract = {The urgency of climate change means that low-carbon transitions are
   needed in large socio-technical systems such as energy and
   transportation. These transitions must be rapid, but also fair. An
   emerging body of evidence suggests that users have important roles in
   transitions, yet much previous research has examined user involvement
   while assuming it to be largely a positive force. This goes against a
   growing amount of evidence within sociotechnical studies that highlight
   the potentially obstructive or negative role that users may play in
   transitions and innovation. In this study, we pose a critical question:
   In what ways may users perpetuate injustices within a transition? To
   answer this question, we provide conceptual background on energy justice
   and user adoption of low-carbon energy and mobility technologies. We
   then analyse users and energy injustices in three low-carbon transitions
   - solar energy in Germany, electric vehicles in Norway, and smart meters
   in Great Britain - based on empirical data from interviews, focus
   groups, and internet forums. Our main contribution is to show how users
   in low-carbon transitions are not always positively engaged, or even
   neutral, but can introduce and contribute to inequality and exclusion.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Abstract = {This article explores the transition to renewable energy for all
   purposes in developing countries. Ethiopia is chosen as a case study and
   is an exemplary of developing countries with comparable climatic and
   socioeconomic conditions. The techno-economic analysis of the transition
   is performed with the LUT Energy System Transition model, while the
   socio-economic aspects are examined in terms of greenhouse gas emissions
   reduction, improved energy services and job creation. Six scenarios were
   developed, which examine various policy constraints, such as greenhouse
   gas emission cost. The Best Policy Scenarios cost less than the Current
   Policy Scenarios and generate more job. The results of this research
   show that it is least costing, least greenhouse gas emitting and most
   job-rich to gradually transition Ethiopia's energy system into one that
   is dominated by solar PV, complemented by wind energy and hydropower.
   The modelling outcome reveals that it is not only technically and
   economically possible to defossilise the Ethiopian energy system, but it
   is the least cost option with greatest societal welfare. This is a first
   of its kind study for the Ethiopian energy system from a long-term
   perspective.

Title = {Climate justice: priorities for equitable recovery from the pandemic},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1307-1317},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Climate justice provides a crucial framework to embed issues of equity
   and justice into COVID-19 recovery strategies. The pandemic, alongside
   climate change, is disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable and
   marginalized people across the globe, and particularly exposing Black,
   Brown, and Indigenous people to ill-health and economic hardship.
   However, there is a risk that economic considerations will take
   precedence over climate action in recovery strategies and avoid
   addressing climate and racial injustices. Yet, it is vital that climate
   and racial justice and just transition principles inform post-COVID-19
   recovery strategies to avoid compounding inequalities. This paper
   unpacks the layers of injustice surrounding the pandemic, along with
   their relation to climate policy and finance. It advocates for
   policymakers to adopt climate justice and just transition principles as
   a framework for COVID-19 recovery strategies to ensure existing
   inequalities in society are recognized and addressed in the run-up to
   the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021 and beyond. Key
   policy insights The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change intersect to
   further compound inequalities between and within nations. Current
   vulnerabilities and historical racial injustices undermine the ability
   of individuals, communities and nations to cope with, and adapt to,
   climate change. Economic considerations have dominated climate and
   development policy, and this must change to include justice and equity
   as key criteria to ensure a green and just recovery. Policymakers should
   pursue climate policymaking designed with broad and diverse communities
   in mind, recognizing diversity and intersectionality, to empower
   marginalized groups. Just transition principles should be mainstreamed
   into investment and financing criteria for climate finance and recovery
   strategies to ensure funding reaches those who need it most.},

Title = {Of renewable energy, energy democracy, and sustainable development: A
   roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in developing countries},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The world faces two pressing challenges: on the one hand, limiting
   global warming to 1.5 degrees C; on the other hand, enabling
   socio-economic development that is inclusive and equitable. These two
   challenges should not be seen as conflicting and should be addressed
   simultaneously. This is particularly true as we look forward to a
   post-COVID recovery efforts. The solution may partially rest on the
   transition to sustainable and renewable energy systems. The energy
   transition comprises presumptions of energy efficiency, affordability,
   reliability, and energy independence. And in developing countries, in
   particular, it also entails expectations of economic development, social
   inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Since most of the remaining
   renewable energy potential lies in developing countries, these countries
   will play a crucial role. This paper reviews the status of the energy
   transition in the Global South, by surveying scientific and grey
   literature and synthesising the wide scope of alternatives available to
   accelerate and enhance the transition to renewable energy systems. The
   alternatives and approaches found are encapsulated in three dimensions:
   technology, society, and policy. A roadmap presents the potential
   synergies that could be established across dimensions and sectors to aid
   the energy transition in developing countries. Concisely, the transition
   can be achieved by adopting and implementing technologies already
   commercially-available that improve the efficiency, affordability, and
   reliability of energy systems, by redefining and reclaiming citizens'
   participation in energy planning and policy-making, and by
   democratically restructuring institutions and monitoring to boost
   transparency, accountability, and trust.},

Abstract = {In recent years, debates about energy justice have become increasingly
   prominent. However, the question of what is at stake in claims about
   energy justice or injustice is a complex one. Signifying more than
   simply the fair distribution of quantities of energy, energy justice
   also implies issues of procedural justice (participation) and
   recognition (acknowledgement of diverse values constitutive of ways of
   life). It is argued that this requires an acknowledgement of why energy
   use matters in everyday life.
   Data from the Energy Biographies project at Cardiff University is used
   to explore connections between the relational texture of everyday life
   and the ethical significance of energy. In particular, it is
   demonstrated that embodiment, attachment and narrative are features of
   sense-making that contribute significantly to everyday understandings of
   the ethical meanings of different ways of using energy. Using multimodal
   and biographical qualitative social science allows these implicit forms
   of evaluation to become more tangible, along with the relationships
   between them. Conceiving of energy consumers as subjects with
   biographies, with attachments, and as engaged bodily in energy
   consumption can open up, it is suggested, different ways of enacting the
   procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice.},

   futures},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The transition to a digital, decarbonised, and decentralised energy
   system presents both risks and opportunities for the domestic consumer.
   Domestic `demand-side response' (DSR), where household electrical
   consumption adjusts in response to external signals, has been envisioned
   in different ways with several trials demonstrating that DSR often has
   variegated and uneven consumer outcomes. This plurality of outcomes
   raises questions about the `winners' and `losers' of pursuing such
   policies and thus brings them into the realm of energy justice - a
   framing that seeks to understand the ethical implications of energy
   systems. This paper, based on an extensive review of current academic
   literature, evaluates the normative implications of DSR in relation to
   the eight principles of energy justice proposed by Sovacool and Dworkin
   (2015). Whilst there are several ways that DSR may create opportunities
   for furthering energy justice, there are also multiple risks of
   injustice, with much depending on how particular DSR programmes are
   designed and the presence or absence of sufficient policies to mitigate
   regressive outcomes. Further empirical research is required to better
   understand the conditions through which DSR can contribute to energy
   justice. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for those
   developing DSR or consumer protection policies related to DSR rollout.},

Title = {Transitions to Future Energy Systems: Learning from a Community Test
   Field},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the challenges of transitioning towards future
   energy systems in a solar test field within the eco-community of Tamera,
   Portugal. We examine what findings can point to wider actionability and
   how. First, we consider how Tamera's solar test field has addressed
   energy transition challenges. We unpack the nature of stability and
   change in achieving 60 percent energy autonomy; trace the linkages to
   spatiotemporal issues implicated in this sociotechnical process informed
   by keen commitment to energy justice; and dwell on the test field's
   socioeconomic considerations at its interface with the Portuguese
   institutional framework and global connections. Second, we identify
   which findings can fertilise policy and action across European contexts.
   Considerations in gradually installing sub-100 kW solar capacity
   contrast starkly with the current proliferation of grid-scale solar in
   southern Portugal, raising questions about the actionability of
   knowledge on sociotechnical transitions. We co-generate ideas on how
   such contextualised epistemological advances can aid our understanding
   of societal energy transitions. The article encourages socially
   informed, integrated policy pathways. It speaks to building
   epistemological complementarities between applied researchers and
   practicing agents; problematises linking across scale between a
   community and institutionalising powers; and calls for actionable
   efforts that integrate systems thinking and power dynamics towards
   transformation.},

   social identity and solar energy transitions in the United States},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As solar adoption across the United States continues to grow, so do the
   gaps between rural and urban communities in how they choose to embrace
   these technologies, leading to serious questions of social justice and
   equity by researchers and policymakers alike. While recent studies have
   examined the racial and social justice elements of solar adoption
   alongside institutions' role in shaping pro-solar policies, codes, and
   code enforcement, an opportunity exists to discuss how the place and
   composition of the body politic in terms of race/ethnicity and rurality
   exists. This paper establishes a methodology for examining location and
   body politic composition concerning adopting all types of solar
   (residential, non-residential, utility-scale), utilizing the State of
   Georgia as a case study. Results indicate that the approach yields
   useful and informative findings; namely, there is a significant
   difference in adopting non-residential and utility-scale solar between
   rural and urban counties. We conclude by discussing further
   opportunities to expand on this analysis and the impact of assessing
   solar adoption in terms of value alignment between a body politic and
   the policies that shape the adoption of sustainable energy technologies.
   Combining solar adoption information for the State of Georgia with
   Census data, this study compares solar adoption trends across
   counties-grouped by urban/rural classification and racial and ethnic
   majority.},

Title = {The German energy transition and the eroding consensus on ecological
   modernization: A radical democratic perspective on conflicts over
   competing justice claims and energy visions},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper makes a threefold contribution to reflecting on the German
   energy transition (Energiewende). First, the shaping of the Energiewende
   by national government policies is analyzed. The prevailing focus on
   questions about technology (promotion and acceptance) is interpreted as
   symptomatic of the depoliticizing paradigm of ecological modernization.
   However, the consensus on the ecomodern approach is eroding, as
   evidenced by increasing conflicts over the implementation of the
   Energiewende. Second, competing justice claims and energy visions that
   are articulated in these conflicts as well as the related disaffection
   with present democratic institutions and their performance are
   elaborated. Third, the insights gained on conflicts over concrete energy
   projects are discussed in the light of democratic theory. Thereby, it is
   argued that a one-sided orientation towards the deliberative democracy
   model further exacerbates the tendencies of disaffection with democratic
   institutions. From a radical democratic perspective, the key to
   constructively addressing both climate and democratic challenges is to
   foster confrontation between competing Energiewende visions. Agonistic
   politics could, in the best case, open up the political scope for
   ambitious energy visions beyond the realm of ecological modernization
   and, at the same time, counteract disenchantment with politics.},

Title = {Towards energy care ethics: Exploring ethical implications of
   relationality within energy systems in transition},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Social science energy research is asking important questions about the
   social, political, and economic implications of energy transitions, and
   the consequent changing roles and relationships in the energy system.
   This has given rise to ethically driven research agendas, with an
   increasing focus on the need to better understand how people relate in
   their daily lives, both to mundane dilemmas around energy use, and to
   bigger questions around energy systems and energy system change.
   Based on insights from empirical Q-methodological research in Denmark
   and the UK, this article illustrates relational understandings of energy
   systems and a language of dependence, necessity and needs as important
   elements in how people make sense of the energy transition and their
   place in it. This challenges dominant frameworks and discourses of
   energy and energy transitions rooted in individualism and a language of
   individual responsibility, rational choice and/or individual rights and
   justice. In this article, we argue that a recognition of relationality
   and (inter)dependence as basic conditions of existence, and as basis for
   ethical reasoning in everyday engagements with energy in transition, is
   key to reflecting ways of relating to energy ethicalities in the
   everyday. This speaks strongly to recent advances of relational theories
   of energy systems and transitions, but calls for a recognition not only
   of inter-connections and relations, but of their ethical significance.
   To this end, we engage a feminist theory of care and care ethics in a
   proposition to `think energy with care'.},

Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {While there are excellent policy and academic foundations for thinking
   about and making sense of urban climate action and questions of justice
   and climate change independently, there is less work that considers
   their intersection. The nature and dynamics of, and requirements for, a
   just urban transition (JUT)-the fusion of climate action and justice
   concerns at the urban scale-are not well understood. In this review
   article we seek to rectify this by first examining the different strains
   of justice scholarship (environmental, energy, climate, urban) that are
   informing and should inform JUT. We then turn to a discussion of just
   transitions in general, tracing the history of the term and current
   understandings in the literature. These two explorations provide a
   foundation for considering both scholarly and policy-relevant JUT
   agendas. We identify what is still needed to know in order to recognize,
   study, and foster JUT.

Title = {Exploring the interaction between social norms and perceived justice of
   wind energy projects: a qualitative analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {The deployment of wind energy projects (WEP) within the process of
   energy transition changes energy landscapes and daily living
   environments. With regard to social acceptance as one social response
   towards WEP, the role of different aspects of justice (i.e. procedural,
   distributive, recognition) has been discussed. This study highlights the
   importance of social norms and their influence on perceived justice
   regarding WEP, which has been neglected in the literature so far. The
   relationship between social norms and perceived justice is explored as a
   conceptual framework through a systematic literature review and expert
   interviews. This framework aims to explain how social norms and their
   relationship with justice are defined, interlinked and how they affect
   perceptions of WEP. The results argue that social norms surface in
   situations where all the key elements of a project are decided without
   public impact. Thus, norms of fairness emerge under uncertain situations
   with the influence of similar emotions within groups. Moreover, social
   norms and perceived justice would explain several responses, such as
   local conflicts, or the motivation to further develop WEP. This study
   concludes by discussing the applicability of the framework, which needs
   further analysis as an analytical tool and deeper empirical
   investigation.},

Title = {Exploring the Contribution of Grassroots Innovations to Justice: Using
   the Capability Approach to Normatively Address Bottom-Up Sustainable
   Transitions Practices},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in the potential of grassroots innovations for
   the transition towards more just and sustainable societies.
   Nevertheless, there is lack of clear normative discussion regarding
   these processes. The paper strives to propose and test a framework that
   enables an analysis of how and in which sense specific grassroots
   innovation processes may be contributing to the construction of more
   just societies. To this end, we connect elements of the multi-level
   perspective on sociotechnical transitions (frequently used in the
   analysis of grassroots innovations) with elements of the capability
   approach, which offers a multi-dimensional perspective to justice. The
   framework is used to address two purposively selected empirical cases in
   two key sectors in Spain: an energy cooperative and a food purchasing
   group. We draw on the information of 25 individual interviews with
   members of these two cases, on observation, and on secondary sources.
   Information was processed by means of a qualitative content analysis. We
   draw on predefined categories from the framework, which was refined
   during the analysis. The paper illustrates that grassroots innovations
   may be contributing to justice in several aspects: they expand
   capabilities in different dimensions, improve public reasoning
   processes, and create better structural conditions for human
   flourishing. Nevertheless, these processes are not free of tensions and
   contradictions.},

Title = {Burdened by renewable energy? A multi -scalar analysis of distributional
   justice and wind energy in the United States},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across
   social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable
   and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing
   and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy
   development has experienced a significant gap between broad public
   support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to
   proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted
   land use. We present the theoretical argument that although the negative
   impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed
   by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally
   unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have
   been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data
   from both the American Community Survey, the U.S. Wind Turbine Database,
   and the National Renewable Energy Lab we use logistic and Poisson
   regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current
   landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of
   income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation,
   and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the
   contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind
   energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We
   do not find strong evidence of distributional injustice along the lines
   of race, ethnicity, or low-income. However, we do find evidence of
   injustice for populations which are younger, less educated, have lower
   labor force participation, and are more rural.},

Title = {Industrial demand-side flexibility: A key element of a just energy
   transition and industrial development},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {269},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {In many countries, industry is one of the largest consumers of
   electricity. Given the special importance of electricity for industry, a
   reliable electricity supply is a basic prerequisite for further
   industrial development and associated economic growth. As countries
   worldwide transition to a low-carbon economy (in particular, by the
   development of renewable energy sources), the increasing fluctuation in
   renewable energy production requires new flexibility options within the
   electricity system in order to guarantee security of supply. It is
   advanced in this paper that such a flexibility transition with an active
   participation of industry in general has unique potential: It will not
   only promote green industrial development, but also become an engine for
   inclusive industrial development and growth as well as delivering a just
   transition to a low-carbon economy. Given the high potential of
   industrial demand-side flexibility, a first monitoring approach for such
   a flexibility transition is illustrated, which bases on a flexibility
   index. Our flexibility index allows for an indication of
   mis-developments and supports an appropriate implementation of
   countermeasures together with relevant stakeholders. Hence, it holds
   various insights for both policy-makers and practice with respect to how
   industrial demand-side flexibility can ensure advances towards an
   inclusive, just, and sustainable industrial development.},

Title = {Authoritarian environmentalism, just transition, and the tension between
   environmental protection and social justice in China's forestry reform},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Authoritarian environmentalism (AE) has become an important source of
   social injustice in China. Taking clues from the theory of just
   transition and a case study of forestry reform in Northeast China, this
   article discusses the tension between environmental protection and
   social justice in Chinese AE. From a procedural perspective, the belief
   in insulated eco-elites being best placed to make environmental
   decisions, and the emphasis on policy expediency, are manifested in the
   top-down imposition of a sweeping ban on logging of natural forests.
   However, this non-participatory approach prevents critical and nuanced
   viewpoints on local impacts to be recognized and addressed. From a
   distributional perspective, while AE does not inherently contradict the
   norm of distributive justice, the forestry reform has negatively
   affected the undercompensated and under-supported laid off workers,
   created new energy poverty issues, undermined local public services, and
   disproportionately affected smaller, remote communities, some of whom
   have been outright abandoned. The findings highlight the need for
   scholars to engage with social justice issues in AE by championing the
   importance of a just transition process, experimenting with public
   engagement in the context of authoritarianism, and generating policy
   knowledge that facilitates the transformation toward sustainability.},

Abstract = {EU has set ambitious commitment to achieve low carbon energy and economy

   The main goal of the paper is to develop indicators framework for
   assessing low carbon just energy transition and to apply this framework
   for analysis how climate change mitigation policies in households
   targeting enhancement of energy renovation of residential buildings and
   promotion of the use of micro-generation technologies and other policies
   are affecting household's energy poverty and vulnerability in selected
   countries: Lithuania and Greece. This framework allows to assess three
   main dimensions of sustainable energy development: environmental, social
   and economic. The paper provides policy recommendations how to deal with
   just low carbon energy transition which means addressing energy poverty
   issues during moving to 100\% renewables in power generation based on

Abstract = {The global energy transition is characterised by a myriad of technology
   options, organisational forms and infrastructural scales across levels
   of operation. Energy transitions are generally considered to foster
   sustainable development. However, technologies deemed sustainable in
   some dimensions can cause environmental or social problems in other
   dimensions or scales. In addition, freedom and self-determination are
   desirable features often associated with cooperative bottom-up
   initiatives. However, these initiatives may not always result in
   appropriate processes and strategies that span ecological and
   socio-technical dimensions. Direct participation or better
   representation of stakeholders ingrained in cooperative structures do
   not necessarily coalesce social and environmental benefits. We
   distinguish between different types of participation options across
   economic, technical and social levels; in line with the concepts of
   energy citizenship and sovereignty. We also differentiate technical
   infrastructure dimensions from those that are more political, economic
   or socially determined. The main purpose of our justice-oriented
   assessment approach is to make explicit unintended and undesirable
   effects of transition processes visible, and to capture the impacts of
   infrastructural and organisational dimensions of energy systems. The
   assessment of case studies qualitatively along several dimensions
   (infrastructural, organisational, impact) revealed which externalities
   result from prosumer-based electricity systems, conventional energy
   utilities and other organisational systems. (C) 2019 Published by

Title = {Conceptualizing rural energy transitions: Energizing rural studies,
   ruralizing energy research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {97-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Academic debates over the spatial implications of energy transitions and
   the realization of sustainable futures have predominantly focused on
   urban areas, which has resulted in the notion of `urban energy
   transitions'. The idea of `rural energy transitions', however, has
   remained rather underexplored. This is surprising because resources
   needed to produce renewable energy constitute a key element of energy
   transitions and are inextricably tied to rural spaces. In particular,
   rural regions accommodate the majority of renewable energy
   infrastructures, such as wind turbines, solar, and biogas plants, as
   well as transmission grids. In that sense, urban energy transitions are
   simply impossible without rural energy transitions. Nevertheless,
   `rural' dimensions of energy transition processes in the Global North
   have received only little scholarly interest, while the main focus of
   academic work has been on urban agglomerations. Despite the growing
   attention afforded to energy-related issues in the social sciences, in
   general, and urban studies and human geography, in particular, rural
   studies have only slowly started engaging with energy transitions as a
   research field. This paper, therefore, combines social science research
   on energy and rural studies to address this research gap. It identifies
   three intersections of both research traditions; namely, rural areas as
   locations for the materialization of energy transitions, contestations
   around energy issues in rural areas, and the emancipatory potentials of
   rural energy transitions. We argue that linking social science energy
   research and rural studies can yield valuable insights into the rural
   character of energy transitions and the role of energy within rural
   change.},

   energy justice},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {176-184},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recently an increasing number of studies have been developing the
   concept of `energy justice'. They explore local and global
   interconnections in energy production, supply and consumption and aim to
   present policymakers with a morally compelling case for shifting
   energy-related policies and practices toward greater fairness: locally,
   globally and across generations. They draw on various notions of justice
   but have not yet explored what it means to make a moral claim, i.e. on
   what basis moral obligations can be said to exist. Hence it is not clear
   what kind of appeal they are making to policymakers. Here I suggest an
   approach to moral claims informed by Wittgenstein's philosophy could
   strengthen their approach. In this view, moral claims do not refer to
   objectively existing, universally applicable ethical truths, but nor are
   they merely statements of preference or affect. Instead, moral
   sensitivity is an essential element in the meaning of life for human
   beings, intrinsic to being a person. It develops through people's
   lifelong involvement in communal practices, together with language about
   obligation and rightness/wrongness. Using this approach together with
   insights from pragmatist philosophers I suggest ways policymakers' moral
   compass could be deepened and extended to respond more readily to energy
   justice concerns.},

Title = {Energy poor need more energy, but do they need more carbon? Evaluation
   of people's basic carbon needs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {187},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the era of low-carbon energy transitions, both climate and energy
   justice studies have raised concerns about the deterioration of energy
   poverty triggered by carbon mitigation policies. Nevertheless, no
   in-depth analysis has thus far examined the relationship between people
   suffering energy poverty and their carbon dioxide emissions. This study
   addresses the issue by presenting a novel approach to measuring people's
   basic carbon needs (BCN), which are defined as the amount of carbon
   emissions needed to achieve (socially and materially) adequate levels of
   domestic energy services. The results, using Japan as a case study,
   reveal the differences in people's BCN based on climatic,
   socio-demographic, and dwelling factors, showing that people in energy
   poverty need greater carbon emissions to fulfil their basic energy needs
   than the affluent population. In upcoming lowcarbon energy transitions,
   people's BCN must be reduced while satisfying their basic energy needs.
   However, this study shows that the carbon intensity of domestic energy
   services for energy poverty households is high, leading carbon
   mitigation policies such as carbon pricing to adversely affect them
   without suitable countermeasures. Hence, ensuring access to low-carbon
   energy for all, including the energy poor, is essential to engender an
   inclusive low-carbon energy transition.},

Title = {Just transition: A conceptual review},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The growing attention paid to the idea of a just transition away from
   the incumbent fossil fuel energy paradigm has led scholars to devise
   diverse definitions, understandings, and viewpoints of the term. This
   review seeks to clarify the different perspectives surrounding the
   concept, to consolidate knowledge, and to provide a concise account of
   current debates in the literature as well as a research agenda. It
   identifies five themes around which the concept has been discussed: (1)
   just transition as a labor-oriented concept, (2) just transition as an
   integrated framework for justice, (3) just transition as a theory of
   socio-technical transition, (4) just transition as a governance
   strategy, and (5) just transition as public perception. Overall, this
   review suggests that the literature on just transition employs rich
   theoretical and empirical insights from various disciplines yet contains
   several gaps. Specifically, it argues that the literature would benefit
   from more empirical studies rooted in practice, more discussion on the
   relationship between different concepts of just transition, an expansion
   of geographical scope to include developing countries and non-democratic
   regimes, and more attention to power dynamics in just transition.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the use of universalizing language as a discursive
   strategy to promote shifts in energy policy. Building on scholarship
   that seeks to understand the political nature of energy transitions,
   including resistance to transitions, the role of the state, and
   implications for justice, we examine three phases of energy transition
   in Ontario in the period 2009-2019, focusing on the ways that three
   successive ruling coalitions used the first plural pronoun ``we{''} to
   promote contrasting energy policy orientations. Our analysis of policy
   documents and government news releases confirms that all three
   coalitions used the ``we{''} form as a strategic device to define
   priorities, prescribe courses of action, and broadcast achievements.
   However, they also used the ambiguity of the ``we{''} form to obscure
   alternative perspectives, claim credit for rivals' accomplishments, and
   gloss over harmful and differentiated impacts of policy choices. The
   paper concludes by reflecting on broader questions about power and
   justice relevant to energy transition scholars.},

Abstract = {Critical minerals will play a vital role in the energy transition. In
   South East Asia like in other regions across the world, there will be an
   additional advantage in that critical mineral development can contribute
   to an economic recovery and in time a green economic recovery. This
   article explores the role of justice in critical mineral development in
   the South East Asian region with a specific focus on Indonesia. The
   recent literature on critical minerals has a very limited focus on the
   role of justice in critical mineral development and this is even more so
   the case for South East Asian countries. This article provides a first
   account, utilising the JUST framework to explore, assess and
   quantitatively examine justice in the critical minerals industry in
   South East Asia and in particular, Indonesia. If the South East Asian
   region is to have a green economic recovery, there has to be a focus on
   achieving justice and reducing unjust outcomes. Indonesia provides
   strong examples for the potential of the industry and the development of
   policy to ensure justice, yet, it presents lessons for other South East
   Asian countries of the pitfalls in such ambition.},

Title = {Controversies of justice, scale, and siting: The uneven discourse of
   renewability in Austrian waste-to-energy development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many geopolitical jurisdictions, including the European Union,
   demonstrate a growing commitment to mitigating climate change through a
   transition to renewable energy production. While ambitious targets and
   the transformations they inspire should be celebrated, it is
   nevertheless increasingly important to understand how renewable energy
   policies and discourses are being mobilized in the rollout of
   controversial energy technologies such as waste incineration. This paper
   engages analytical lenses from environmental justice scholarship on
   discourse, scale, and waste siting controversies to contribute to the
   emerging literature on the competing ways that actors frame
   controversial energy technologies. Specifically, drawing on case study
   research conducted in Austria from 2013 to 2015, it asks in what
   contexts, and by whom, are discourses of renewability enrolled in
   relation to waste-to-energy planning and management? Findings
   demonstrate the divergent ways in which Austrian and European Union
   policy elites and local residents frame waste incineration vis-a-vis its
   renewability. Ultimately, the article argues that framing discrepancies
   between policy elites and local residents are a reflection of procedural
   injustice.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {215-229},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper describes how a green energy surplus region changed over the
   years to a thermal energy-mix, driven by environmentalist forces' strong
   opposition to Hydro-Electric Power Projects (HEPPs) in Kerala, India.
   The specific instance of the proposed Athirappilly HEPP is discussed
   against the background of the opposition of environmentalists and other
   sympathetic associations. The strong opposition to HEPPs in specific
   local contexts has led to increased emissions in other places. The
   tenets of Energy Justice distributional, procedural, recognition and
   cosmopolitan have been challenged by the environmentalists' movement
   against the Athirappilly HEPP. The inherent conflicts between
   Environment Law and Climate Law on the one hand and the principles of
   Energy Justice and Law on the other are pointed out. The concept of
   ``Power-Environ{''} is introduced and characterized, and its relation to
   Energy Justice and Law is explored in the policy context. The concept
   proposed here serves as a foundation for realizing parsimonious and
   effective representation of the opposition to HEPPs, and ushering Energy
   Justice and Law. The use of this concept, as an integrated whole founded
   on the principles of Energy Justice and Law, should facilitate balanced
   policy-making in the Energy sector, especially in India and hopefully
   across the world too.},

Title = {Defining and conceptualising energy policy failure: The when, where,
   why, and how},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {161},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Energy policy failure is complex and to date there is a lack of a clear
   definition as society advances to a low carbon world. Here a new
   definition is proposed, where energy policy does not meet local,
   national, and international energy and climate goals across the
   activities of the energy life-cycle and where just outcomes are not
   delivered. Energy policy failure is a major problem given the global aim
   of a low-carbon society, thus this paper conceptually sets out and
   defines energy policy failure in light of the energy transition, the
   2015 Paris Agreement and the necessity of meeting energy and climate
   commitments. This conceptual research marks a first in connecting the
   current extensive energy justice literature with that of energy failure
   and under the premise of the climate emergency (announced by the United
   Nations in 2020). The direction here is both from a legal and an
   interdisciplinary perspective which is vital to energy research. The
   paper highlights the key literature on energy failures such as collapsed
   incentives, abandoned projects, mistakes, wrong paths, and bad
   decisions. It analyses some of the key causes and consequences of these
   energy policy failures, and aims to offer a solution for resolving them
   that meets the requirements of the just energy transition. At the heart
   of the paper's solution is the aim of furthering more fairness,
   equality, equity and inclusiveness into energy project decision-making,
   so that justice is at the centre of energy project development. Ensuring
   that this is the case will reduce a whole variety of project risks,
   result in successful project completion and reduce the possibility of
   energy policy failure, as society moves from the energy transition into
   net zero frameworks.},

Title = {Engendering an inclusive low-carbon energy transition in Japan:
   Considering the perspectives and awareness of the energy poor},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {135},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Engendering a low-carbon energy transition is necessary to limit climate
   change impacts and temperature rises. Ideally, this transition would be
   inclusive, incorporating all stakeholders, however, the issue of energy
   or fuel poverty is a major obstacle to this goal. This research
   investigates energy poverty in Japan using a subjective,
   multidimensional energy poverty measure, clarifying the linkages between
   energy poverty and an inclusive, just transition in terms of energy
   system and policy awareness, behavior and preferences. Through the
   analysis of an original survey, we uncover that there is a marked
   difference between low-income and energy poverty households'
   environmental awareness, and their subsequent attitude toward the
   low-carbon energy transition. Currently, the energy poor have a negative
   attitude toward the low-carbon energy transition in Japan, causing a
   lack of self-reported engagement which will not engender an inclusive,
   just transition. Our findings suggest that if the Japanese low-carbon
   energy transition were to be inclusive, a further 5 percent of
   households could participate in the low-carbon energy transition through
   access to solar or renewable energy capital. Findings identify the need
   for policies targeted at the energy poor, specifically promoting access
   to solar capital and low-carbon technologies, in addition to existing
   policies targeted at low-income households.},

Abstract = {Clean energy is going transnational. Following the COP21 UN Climate
   Change Conference in December 2015, a roll-out of clean energy schemes
   in the global South is fostering a global energy transition. One such
   case is South Africa, where a policy innovation - the Renewable Energy
   Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) - was
   introduced in 2011. While REIPPPP seems to be a success story in terms
   of renewable energy capacity, it is unclear how the instrument is
   shaping the overall course of South Africa's green transformation
   regarding the influence of transnational actors, participation in local
   ownership, and socio-economic benefits. Based on expert interviews and
   empirical process tracing of the renewable energy projects during the
   five bidding rounds of REIPPPP (2011-2016), the article analyses the
   design and effects of REIPPPP and discusses its implications for
   transition strategies, such as a `just transition'.},

Title = {The prospects of decentralised solar energy home systems in rural
   communities: User experience, determinants, and impact of free solar
   power on the energy poverty cycle},
Journal = {ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Distributed solar photovoltaic is a well-established technology to meet
   small-scale rural energy needs in an affordable, reliable, and
   carbon-neutral manner. Such socio-technical transitions offer
   substantive support to address energy poverty and act as a key tool to
   realise human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental
   conservation envisioned under Sustainable development goals (SDGs). In
   this study, households using solar photovoltaic were surveyed to
   determine prospects of solar energy use in rural communities. The
   participants include rural households from Uttar Pradesh, India that had
   received i) a small scale and subsidised solar systems, ii) obtained
   paid connection from solar microgrids, and iii) those who purchased
   solar systems for power reliability. We report high satisfaction with
   distributed solar photovoltaic among rural households. The factors
   influencing a desire to procure additional solar power include income,
   level of education, duration of solar use, user satisfaction, time of
   day for the power supply and financial support for procurement. Our
   findings also suggest that freely given solar power offers limited
   incentives for procuring more solar power. We further analyse the policy
   of welfare using energy justice as a conceptual tool. This can explain
   paradoxical aspects of subsidies that are widely used as a
   socio-political tool to improve quality of life for those that are
   disadvantaged but fail to address fundamental structural aspects of the
   energy system that are underscored by procedural justice issues. We
   propose policies for distributed clean energy in emerging countries must
   address concurrent energy transitions and energy justice frameworks to
   support sustained decentralised solar transitions. Without these two
   foundations operating in tandem, carbon lock-in and the energy poverty
   cycle will be inexorably linked.},

Title = {Procedural injustices in large-scale solar energy: a case study in the
   Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {There is a clear need for improving justice and sustainability in the
   implementation of renewable energy projects. Assessing energy justice in
   contexts with high cultural and ecological diversity as well as high
   levels of marginalisation, and a post-colonial history (of domination
   and resistance to it), requires taking into account the local contextual
   understandings of justice. Current literature, however, has been mostly
   developed under the evidence and concepts of Global North contexts,
   which tend to build in universal ideas of justice, often inappropriate
   for policy application in the Global South. To contribute to closing
   this gap, the paper qualitatively analyses the implementation of a
   large-scale photovoltaic project in Yucatan, Mexico, examining how
   neighbouring indigenous communities and other key actors perceive,
   experience and react to procedural and socio-environmental justice
   issues in the project's implementation. Results show that commonly-used
   concepts such as consent, participation and inclusion -as currently
   applied in the siting of renewable infrastructure- are now mostly
   perceived as legitimation of projects that align with the developer and
   governmental priorities. Emphasising self-determination over and above
   the aforementioned concepts is seen as a priority among affected
   communities for achieving a more socially just energy transition.},

Title = {Scale, history and justice in community wind energy: An empirical review},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although there is a clear positive link between community wind energy
   (CWE) projects and social acceptance, there is still empirical and
   conceptual ambiguity concerning the details of why. To fill this gap, we
   revisit foundational papers in this field and then, focusing on
   empirical case studies between 2010 and 2018 (n = 15), trace how recent
   research has engaged with existing conceptual frameworks. Most empirical
   researchers verify the importance of the two key dimensions defined by
   Walker \& Devine-Wright {[}1]: process and outcome, and then relate this
   to procedural justice and distributive justice. Meanwhile, the core
   concept of ``community{''} has been deployed, in both practice and
   research, in so many different and sometimes ambiguous ways that it
   remains difficult to assert if, and how, community-based renewable
   energy policy and siting practice produces high levels of local
   community acceptance. We suggest that parsing out the scale of
   investment in wind energy projects and the local historical context of
   energy transitions add clarity to the Walker \& Devine-Wright framework
   as it relates to CWE; providing important conceptual nuance for guiding
   policy, developer practices and future empirical research.},

Title = {Energy Justice in Slum Rehabilitation Housing: An Empirical Exploration
   of Built Environment Effects on Socio-Cultural Energy Demand},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The interaction of energy and buildings institutes a complex
   socio-technical system that influences the eudemonic well-being of the
   occupants. Understanding these drivers become even more necessary in
   impoverished areas where occupants struggle to avail essential energy
   services. The literature indicates that energy injustice can be
   addressed through provisioning of comfort, cleanliness, and convenience
   (3Cs) as critical cultural energy services in low-income areas. This
   study investigates the socio-architectural influence for slum
   rehabilitation housing (SRH) on cultural energy services that can
   promote distributive justice. The methodology adopts an empirical route
   using data from 200 household surveys from SRH in Mumbai, India, and
   Joao Pessoa, Brazil. A model between the 3Cs and socio-architectural
   elements was established using Firth's binary logistic regression. The
   survey results showed that the SRH in Brazil had twice the appliance
   ownership as compared to the Mumbai SRH. There were distinct energy
   service preferences in the study areas, despite common poverty burdens.
   The empirical results showed that the lack of socio-architectural design
   elements like open spaces, privacy, and walkability in the study areas
   demanded specific comfort and convenience appliances as a
   counter-response. A critical policy implication drawn was on the need
   for socio-architectural inclusive energy planning for distributive
   justice in poverty. Mitigating rising energy demand through appropriate
   built environment design of slum rehabilitation housing can contribute
   to fulfilling the UN's SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy) and 11
   (sustainable cities and communities) goals.},

Title = {Intersectionality and energy transitions: A review of gender, social
   equity and low-carbon energy},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Transitions to low-carbon energy systems are essential to meeting global
   commitments to climate change mitigation. Yet ``greening{''} energy
   systems may not make them any fairer, inclusive or just. In this paper,
   we review the academic literature to understand the state of knowledge
   on how diffusion of low-carbon technologies impacts gender and social
   equity in intersectional ways. Our findings indicate that renewable
   energy projects alone cannot achieve gender and social equity, as energy
   interventions do not automatically tackle the structural dynamics
   embedded within socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts. If existing
   power asymmetries related to access and resource distribution are not
   addressed early on, the same structural inequalities will simply be
   replicated and transferred over into new energy regimes.},

Title = {Energy-Sufficiency for a Just Transition: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Efforts to achieve an energy transition often neglect to account for the
   levelling of benefits realizable with higher levels of energy use,
   despite knowledge of a saturation effect and recognition of increasing
   harms of use. This research examines energy sufficiency as a maximum
   quantity of energy associated with improvements in human well-being to
   inform a recalibration of energy targets among high-energy societies. A
   systematic review of recent research was performed to identify the point
   at which increasing levels of energy use no longer correlate with
   meaningful increases in well-being. For selected studies (n = 18),
   energy sufficiency values range from 60-221 gigajoules per capita per
   year with a mean of 132 gigajoules per capita per year for associated
   measures of well-being. The review finds agreement in a pattern of
   saturation and provides a range of values for energy sufficiency
   maximums, suggesting that a relatively modest amount and a diverse
   quality of energy is needed to support high levels of human well-being.
   Beyond the conventional emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable
   energy, energy sufficiency therefore offers a necessary and
   complementary approach for supporting just and ecological energy
   transitions.},

Abstract = {In the layperson's imagination, energy is an abstract concept,
   disconnected from social and ecological realities, while in reality it
   is the cornerstone of all human and natural interactions; thus, energy
   policy can be seen as a representation of how part of nature has been
   appropriated, managed, and represented. This article offers an analysis
   of Colombian energy policy through its National Energy Plans, and an
   examination of the energy transitions that the country has experienced
   in the last forty years. The analysis of the Colombian case demonstrates
   that the central objective of energy planning and its institutional
   framework has been the advancement and maximization of the exploitation
   of energy resources for export purposes, instead of providing a guide to
   reorganize the system towards the reduction of energy consumption, the
   progressive replacement of non-renewable resources in favor of renewable
   sources, or energy justice.},

Title = {Who is marginalized in energy justice? Amplifying community leader
   perspectives of energy transitions in Ghana},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is a divide in energy access studies, between
   technologically-focused modeling papers in engineering and economics,
   and energy justice frameworks and principles grounded in social
   sciences. Quantitative computational models are necessary when analyzing
   energy, and more specifically electricity, systems, as they are
   technologically-complex systems that can diverge from intuitive
   patterns. To assure energy justice, these models must be reflective of,
   and informative to, a wide range of stakeholders, including households
   and communities alongside utilities, governments, and others. Yet,
   moving from a qualitative understanding of preferences to quantitative
   modeling is challenging. In this perspective piece, we pilot the use of
   the value-focused thinking framework to inform stakeholder engagement.
   The result is a strategic objective hierarchy that highlights the
   tradeoffs and the social, economic and technological factors that need
   to be measured in models. We apply the process in Ghana, using a survey,
   stakeholder workshops, and follow-up interviews to uncover key tradeoffs
   and stakeholder-derived objectives. We discuss three key areas that have
   been rarely, if ever, well-represented in energy models: (1) the
   relationship between the dynamics of electricity end-use and the
   technology and economic structure of the system; (2) explicit tradeoffs
   between electricity access, cost, and reliability as defined by
   stakeholders; and (3) the definition of new objectives, such as
   minimizing hazards related to theft. We conclude that this model of
   engagement provides an opportunity to tie together rigorous qualitative
   analysis and stakeholder engagement with crucial quantitative models of
   the electricity system.},

Title = {Pluralising the European energy landscape: Collective renewable energy
   prosumers and the EU's clean energy vision},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To fulfil the European Union's (EU) goal of providing `Clean Energy for
   All Europeans', a transformative shift from centralised, fossil-fuel
   based systems to decentralised systems based on renewable energy sources
   (RES) is envisaged. Keen to lead the clean energy transition while
   embedding technological innovation and elements of justice and
   equitability into the envisioned `Energy Union', EU Member States need
   their citizens on board as active participants. Prosumerism or
   self-consumption is an important part of this citizen involvement. While
   the new EU regulatory framework for energy now recognises civic-inspired
   prosumer initiatives such as energy communities, little is known about
   the full range and diversity of collective actors in renewable energy
   self-consumption as well as how they engage with the changing energy
   system. This paper presents an exploratory categorisation of the
   different collective social actors that produce and consume energy from
   renewable sources, referred to as `collective RES prosumers', aiming to
   clarify their participation in the energy landscape. We find six
   categories with different engagement and needs, which we relate to the
   EU's current framing of collective energy actors. We recommend
   fine-tuning policies to the different actors to support a true-to-vision
   transposition of the recently completed Clean Energy Package (CEP).},

Title = {Designing for justice in electricity systems: A comparison of smart grid
   experiments in the Netherlands},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {147},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In future urban energy systems, smart grid systems will be crucial for
   the integration of renewable energy. However, their deployment has moral
   implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or
   distribution of responsibilities. `Energy justice' is one of the most
   comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains
   limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for
   designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering
   the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid
   projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects
   are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design.
   Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content
   analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with
   insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and
   procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data
   governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology
   inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future
   research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons
   and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We
   conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid
   experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through
   electricity sector regulation.},

Title = {An Enabling Framework to Support the Sustainable Energy Transition at
   the National Level},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The world is fighting against the impacts of the climate crisis.
   Although the technical feasibility of 100\% renewable energy systems was
   already verified by a variety of research studies, there were still more
   than 200 GW of unsustainable new coal power capacity under construction
   at a global level in 2018. To achieve the required carbon neutrality,
   current energy systems need to be transformed toward sustainable energy.
   The review of the literature has shown that several barriers for
   carbon-neutral technologies exist, which currently impede the
   sustainable transition. This paper focuses on the development of an
   enabling framework to overcome existing barriers to facilitate
   sustainable and carbon-neutral technologies at the national level.
   Additionally, it should support decision makers to consider all
   underlying criteria of this urgently needed energy transition. The
   criteria of such an enabling framework can be classified in 11
   categories, which are (1) environmental and ecological protection; (2)
   society, culture, and behavior; (3) equity and justice; (4) knowledge;
   (5) energy markets; (6) energy policy; (7) legal requirements; (8)
   finance; (9) institutions; (10) infrastructure; and (11) clash of
   interests. Even though some criteria differ from country to country, a
   strong governmental support for the transition is always required to be
   successful.},

Title = {A Review of Energy Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa as a Transition
   Pathway to Energy Democracy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Energy communities have received considerable attention in the Global
   North, especially in Europe, due to their potential for achieving
   sustainable energy transitions. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), energy
   communities have received less attention partly due to the nascent
   energy systems in many emerging SSA states. In this paper, we argue that
   these nascent energy systems offer an opportunity to co-create energy
   communities that can tackle the energy access challenges faced by most
   SSA countries. To understand how such energy communities are realised in
   the sub-region, we undertake a systematic review of research on energy
   communities in 46 SSA countries. Our findings show that only a few
   energy projects exhibit the conventional characteristics of energy
   communities; In most of these projects, local communities are
   inadequately resourced to institute and manage their own projects. We
   thus look to stakeholder engagement approaches to propose co-design as a
   strategy for strengthening energy communities in SSA. We further embed
   our co-design proposal in energy democracy thinking to argue that energy
   communities can be a pathway towards equity and energy justice in SSA.
   We conclude that energy communities can indeed contribute to improving
   energy access in Africa, but they need an enabling policy environment to
   foster their growth and sustainability.},

Title = {Connecting the grids: A review of blockchain governance in distributed
   energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for
   socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner
   energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy
   incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance
   dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed
   energy systems. The purpose of this review is to assess the potential
   role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of
   sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the
   governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the
   emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing
   on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in
   overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions.
   The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study
   from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature.
   Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose
   is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the
   theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings
   show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome
   institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced
   coordination for community-based energy transitions.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {332-347},

Abstract = {This research examines the societal impacts of varying energy policy
   approaches and the progress of the energy transition toward a low carbon
   energy-based regime internationally. Using indicators relevant to energy
   policy and the energy transition, five critical social equity impacts of
   environmental improvement, health, employment, participation, and energy
   cost are investigated from the viewpoint of an `equitable' energy
   transition. We investigate the correlation between quantitative social
   equity impacts and the shift toward new renewable energy-based
   electricity (i. e., wind, photovoltaic, geothermal, tidal, biomass etc.)
   from 1990 to 2015, for 99 nations with differing development levels,
   energy resources and policies. We find that increased levels of new
   renewable energy deployment generally accompany social equity
   improvement, however geography, national income level and complementary
   energy policies are also important. Our results highlight specific
   issues for developing nations, whereby electricity needs are often met
   by fossil fuels prior to the large-scale penetration of renewables.
   These nations enjoy short-term social equity benefits, at the risk of
   long-term negative social equity outcomes. This study's holistic
   evaluation of energy transitions and social equity outcomes could be
   used as an input to proactive policy development contributing to the
   realization of a more equitable energy transition.},

Abstract = {The concept of a `just transition' to a low-carbon economy is firmly
   embedded in mainstream global discourses about mitigating climate
   change. Drawing on Karl Polanyi's political economy elaborated in The
   Great Transformation, we interrogate the idea of a just transition and
   place it within its historical context. We address a major contradiction
   at the core of global energy transition debates: the rapid shift to
   low-carbon energy-systems will require increased extraction of minerals
   and metals. In doing so, we argue that extractive industries are energy
   and carbon-intensive, and will enlarge and intensify social and
   ecological injustice. Our findings reveal the importance of
   understanding how the idea of a just transition is used, and by who, and
   the type of justice that underpins this concept. We demonstrate the need
   to ground just transition policies and programmes in a notion of justice
   as fairness.},

Abstract = {The concept of a `just transition' positions justice concerns of

   largely neglected conflicts that arise between sustainability and
   justice goals. A framework is developed to identify three main tensions
   that planners and activists may encounter in efforts to advance a just
   transition. First, the `sustainability-inclusivity' tension involves
   conflicts between rapid and bold policy action in time-sensitive
   contexts and inclusive governance processes. Second, the
   `sustainability-recognition' tension involves conflicts between
   sustainability performance and recognition of diverse value systems and
   rights. Third, the `sustainability-equity' tension involves conflicts
   between achieving sustainability performance and equitable distribution
   of benefits and burdens. Identifying and intentionally responding to
   such tensions is crucial to advance a just transition in the context of
   growing domestic and international inequality, the erosion of worker
   rights, and a warming climate.},

Abstract = {As energy transitions advance through the introduction of renewable

   flexible electricity consumption has risen on agendas among system
   designers and scholars. Social scientists have followed this development
   through studies of technological visions and users of new flexibility
   techniques (e.g. demand-side management, pricing, storage). Based on
   interviews with electricity systems developers and householders in
   Norway this article complements this body of scholarship and relates it
   to emerging themes in sustainability transitions research. We focus on
   end-user flexibility and operationalize the new concept of flexibility
   capital, developed within energy justice literature, to examine
   different framings of flexibility. The research examines how some
   householders have more capability of being flexible than others.
   Furthermore, we show how consumer understandings of flexibility are
   embedded in everyday life, and differs from systems developers, who
   primarily understands flexibility as acting economically rational and
   making cost-conscious decisions.},

Title = {Synthesizing value sensitive design, responsible research and
   innovation, and energy justice: A conceptual review},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many academic approaches that claim to consider the broad set of social
   and ethical issues relevant to energy systems sit side-by-side without
   conversation. This paper considers three such literatures: Value
   Sensitive Design, Responsible Research and Innovation and the Energy
   Justice framework. We argue that whilst definitions of these concepts
   appear, on face value, to be united by a common normative goal -
   improving the social outcomes and mitigating sensitivities at the
   interface of technological energy systems and human livelihoods -, their
   existence in academic silos has obscured complementarities, which, once
   synthesized, might increase their overall academic and practical
   relevance. This paper fills the emergent gap of critically discussing
   the concepts and their strengths and challenges as well as how they
   could contribute to each other. It compares: (1) the things that they
   claim to tackle, (2) the solutions they claim to provide and (3) the
   points that clearly distinguish one approach from another (if any at
   all). Not only does this make this paper the first of its kind, but it
   also makes it an impactful one. With each concept gaining various
   degrees of support in academia and practice, our discussion reveals
   where tensions exist and where positive gains can be made. We identify
   five opportunities for collaboration and integration with implications
   for the achievement of energy systems that are acceptable from a
   societal and ethical perspective.},

Title = {Infant feeding and the energy transition: A comparison between
   decarbonising breastmilk substitutes with renewable gas and achieving
   the global nutrition target for breastfeeding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {324},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Renewable gas has been proposed as a solution to decarbonise industrial
   processes, specifically heat demand. As part of this effort, the
   breast-milk substitutes industry is proposing to use renewable gas as a
   substitute for fossil natural gas. However, decarbonising the industrial
   processing of breast-milk substitutes can increase social license for
   these products, potentially undermining breastfeeding. World Health
   Organisation nutrition targets aim to increase exclusive breastfeeding
   to at least 50\% globally by 2025 to improve maternal, infant, and young
   child health and nutrition. This target will have implications for the
   energy transition. A weakness of existing energy models is that demands
   for end-use products such as breast-milk substitutes are typically not
   considered explicitly. This paper develops an analytical framework for
   explicitly representing infant feeding methods in energy systems models.
   We compare the emissions saved in Ireland from decarbonising the
   industrial processing of breast-milk substitutes with renewable gas with
   the emissions saved by an increase in exclusive breastfeeding to 50\% in
   both Ireland and a key export market, China. We demonstrate that the
   emissions saved from achieving the minimum global breastfeeding target
   are greater than when renewable gas is used to displace natural gas in
   the production of breast-milk substitutes in Ireland. We discuss the
   decarbonisation of breast-milk substitutes in relation to the principle
   of justice as non-maleficence, a principle based on the commitment to
   avoid harm, a novel application of a principle of justice. We conclude
   that breastfeeding support can be considered a demandside measure for
   mitigating climate change by reducing the demand for energy services to
   produce breast-milk substitutes. A key recommendation is to position
   breastfeeding support as both a public health and a climate justice
   issue that is relevant for a just transition. The framework developed
   for this paper could be applied to support the inclusion of a wider
   range of mitigation options with social justice outcomes in energy
   system models.},

Title = {Hidden Energy Flow indicator to reflect the outsourced energy
   requirements of countries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Globalisation and the outsourcing of industrial manufacturing from
   developed to less developed countries has an increasing effect on the
   national energy balances of most developed economies. The current
   standard metric Total Primary Energy Supply of a country does not take
   into account the energy embodied in goods and services imported from
   other countries, leading to the perverse outcome of a country appearing
   to be more sustainable the more it outsources its energy-intensive
   industries. Academia has addressed this problem by suggesting the use of
   the Total Primary Energy Footprint as an additional metric, but there
   has not been a clear proposal put forward by academia to governments or
   international institutions about how to officially adopt
   Consumption-Based Accounting in the field of energy. This article states
   that acknowledging the existence of embodied energy flows is
   indispensable when formulating new national and international energy
   policies for the transition towards energy systems that are socially and
   environmentally more sustainable. In this study, the Hidden Energy Flow
   indicator of 44 countries has been quantified using, for the first time,
   five different Global Multi-Regional Input-Output databases for the
   latest available year, 2011. The proposed indicator provides a
   percentage to be added to or subtracted from the Total Primary Energy
   Used value of a country, provided by the International Energy Agency, to
   get its real consumption-based energy requirement. This study
   demonstrates that, from 44 countries analysed, the ten most developed
   countries demand on average 18.5\% more energy than measured by the
   International Energy Agency; the medium developed 24 countries demand
   12.4\% more, and the ten least developed countries demand 1.6\% less.
   This means that most developed and medium developed countries displace
   their indirect energy consumption towards less developed countries in a
   hidden way. Furthermore, this research supports evidence that direct
   energy consumption in households is less relevant than the energy
   embodied in goods and services purchased by households, reaching 59.1\%
   in the case of Switzerland, used as a reference among developed
   countries. The proposed Hidden Energy Flow indicator supports
   scientists, policymakers and citizens in the effort to focus the energy
   transition actions towards conducting the necessary energy consumption
   and production changes in the most effective way, improving energy
   justice and energy democracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In France and Germany, significant networks of local initiatives have
   developed around energy issues. This article brings practitioners'
   viewpoints into discussion. It presents the way in which two of these
   networks - the CLER-network for the energy transition (France) and the
   100\% - Regions network (Germany) - each identifies itself, describes
   its action and build-up process in relation to government action, and
   conceives of justice issues in the field of climate energy policy. The
   analysis shows that these two networks share a lot, including political
   ends (localisation of energy production, empowerment of rural
   territories), but practice quite differently as intermediaries for local
   initiatives. This suggests overcoming the transition management vs
   grassroots divide present in the literature and paying more attention to
   hybrids. It also brings emphasis on a type of intermediary's work, which
   has not been covered by the academic literature, namely that of
   tinkering with multiple supports and embedding action in
   local-national-supranational networking in order to maintain continuity.
   In discussing justice dimensions, we emphasize that motives or ends of
   action are only reflectively related to ideas of justice: justice issues
   seem bound up with a politics of assembling, either as a marker of
   federative action (all fighting for justice) or as a potentially
   divisive issue.},

   stakeholders was collected, first to qualify just transition barriers
   and then to quantify their relevance and intergroup variance. The
   resulting policy implications highlight three essential factors, a

Title = {Digitalisation and social inclusion in multi-scalar smart energy
   transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Activity generated around smart energy transitions risks undermining a
   basic spatial planning principle: create better places for inhabitants.
   The possibilities unleashed by digitalisation have enigmatic force.
   Stepping back from this techno-centrism, this article asks: where are
   the people in these visions? How can energy sector digitalisation become
   people-centric and inclusive? It employs a multi-scalar approach to
   examine social inclusion in case studies of two smart energy
   transitions: electricity sector digitalisation in Lisbon, and mobility
   sector digitalisation in Bergen. This reveals how planning and
   implementing sustainability transitions can exacerbate existing
   inequalities, but equally offers opportunities to enable inclusive smart
   energy transitions.},

Title = {Energy democracy and social movements: A multi-coalition perspective on
   the politics of sustainability transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {177-189},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study develops research on social movements, political coalitions,
   and sustainability transitions with a multi-coalition perspective. The
   perspective begins with a typology of coalitions based on two pairs of
   goals-general societal change versus the sociotechnical transition of an
   industry or technological system, and sunrising versus sunsetting of
   systems and structures. Mapping the diversity of energy-transition
   coalitions makes it possible not only to identify the various wings of a
   broader industrial transition movement in a specified time and place but
   also to show the dynamics of how coalitions interact and change over
   time. Drawing on case studies of four energy-transition coalitions in
   New York State that approximate the four ideal types, the study shows
   differences in the goals, strategies, organizational composition, and
   frames of the coalitions. The study then shows the mechanisms that
   enable integration across coalitions, including the role of bridge
   brokers and new frames. As the networks of the energy-transition
   coalitions become more connected, the organizations make use of a wider
   set of frames, including the newer frame of energy democracy. Thus, the
   study develops an approach to the study of energy democracy that shows
   how it can serve as a frame that bridge brokers use to integrate
   coalitions.},

Title = {Implementing a just renewable energy transition: Policy advice for
   transposing the new European rules for renewable energy communities},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {156},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The recast of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) provides an
   enabling framework for ``Renewable Energy Communities{''} (RECs) that is
   being transposed into law by the 27 European Union Member States by June
   2021. RECs are majority owned by local members or shareholders who are
   authorized to share energy within the community, offering the potential
   to unlock private investment and financing for renewable energy sources
   and provide social benefits. However, successful implementation and a
   just energy transition requires the coupling of technological solutions
   with more open decision making, based on sound analysis, knowledge of
   engineering, spatial planning, and social science. We argue that
   financing and ownership models that address renewable energy
   complementarity, spatial organization of resource potential,
   demographics, pushback from incumbents, and inclusion of traditionally
   marginalized groups, are common issues across all Member States that are
   crucial for the transposition of RED II and a just energy transition.
   This paper highlights the benefits and challenges of widespread
   development of RECs, and using examples from the pending transposition
   process provides policy advice for effective implementation of the RED
   II with respect to RECs.},

   energy system change in Great Britain},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {236-246},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Energy transitions in Great Britain (GB) require public engagement and
   acceptance, but it is not clear how energy system change is to be
   financed. In this paper we explore public views on responsibility (of
   the government in Great Britain, energy companies and residents) to pay
   for costs associated with energy system change and personal acceptance
   to contribute financially. Five focus groups with 6-9 participants each,
   were conducted in four locations across GB. Using thematic analysis to
   examine responsibility and the role of trust we identified three themes
   relating to 1) views on profits, 2) lack of transparency and 3) the
   perceived problematic relationship between energy companies and
   government. Participants assigned greater responsibility to
   institutional actors and did not believe that these actors were
   currently contributing sufficiently. Although participants were prepared
   to accept some additional costs because they were in favour of energy
   transitions, they also expressed distrust towards the other actors due
   to concerns over the profit driven energy system, lack of transparency
   and perceived close connections between the energy industry and
   government. These concerns could result in reduced public support for
   transitions if they remain unaddressed; they highlight a demand for a
   more equal distribution of costs and benefits and fairer processes in
   the energy system and transitions.},

Title = {Renewable energy transition under multiple colonialisms: passive

Journal = {CULTURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {570-593},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {This essay outlines intermedia theory's contribution to the emerging
   multiple colonialisms framework and argues that a socio-ecological
   reproduction feminist approach to the multiple colonialisms problematic
   is critically necessary for thinking through the contradictions of
   renewable energy transition. A multiple colonialisms framework needs to
   be a kind of utopian theorizing, I argue, just as any feminist renewable
   energy transition seeking to realize energy democracy and energy justice
   must create a utopian collective praxis that regenerates common-being
   and reproduces common wealth. Drawing on research on a network of
   petroleum-free subaltern feminist agricultural cooperatives in Medak,
   India, and on the creativity of their media practices, this article
   examines the social contradictions of energy democracy and just
   transition politics in a conjuncture defined by green passive revolution
   and fascism redux. The essay proposes the concepts of subaltern
   counter-environments' and molecular media' to decolonize energy
   democracy and just transition discourse and to articulate the importance
   of an autonomous domain of subaltern politics for a degrowth strategy of
   regenerative delinking through and against the state. Molecular media
   created by the Feminist Energy Futures research collaboration at the
   University of Alberta seek to regenerate the bias of time in our
   contemporary intermedia ecology where the bias of spectacularized and
   colonized space is otherwise dominant so that regenerative delinking
   strategies can endure social contradictions they embody through
   subaltern counter-environments they can create.},

Title = {Distributed solar and environmental justice: Exploring the demographic
   and socio-economic trends of residential PV adoption in California},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of distributed solar adoption in California provides an
   opportunity to lower electricity bills for the adopters and realize
   additional community benefits, including grid resilience and lower grid
   emissions. It is unclear, however, whether this transition is occurring
   equitably across the state's various demographic and socioeconomic
   groups and whether historically disadvantaged environmental justice (EJ)
   communities have been able to exploit the bill savings and other
   associated benefits of rooftop solar. Here we analyze the cumulative and
   annualized (spatial and temporal) rates of PV adoption across California
   and compare those with data from the state's cumulative impact EJ
   methodology (CalEnviroScreen). We find persistently lower levels of PV
   adoption in disadvantaged communities, suggesting clear distributive and
   equity impacts of existing PV support policies, and indicating that the
   benefits bypass some of the state's most vulnerable populations. The
   analysis reveals strong correlation of solar adoption with not only
   socioeconomic variables, but also with health, environmental and
   demographic indicators, contributing to our growing understanding of the
   role these factors play in household clean-energy adoption trends. The
   results provide a baseline from which to develop more effective
   policies, strategically design incentives, and track the efficacy of
   existing solar programs that target disadvantaged communities.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {21-41},
Abstract = {`Energy democracy' epitomizes hopes in energy transformation, but
   remains under-defined, a political buzzword rather than a real concept.
   After presenting its activist roots and mapping its usage, `energy
   democracy' is positioned in relation to similar normatively derived
   concepts: environmental, climate, and energy justice, and environmental
   democracy. Drawing on insights from political theory and political
   sociology, it is shown what is democratic in energy democracy.
   Referencing the question of experts and democratic publics in complex
   technological areas, the paper explains why it is desirable for energy
   governance to be more democratic. To show what is unique in `energy
   democracy' beyond increased participation in energy policy, the prosumer
   is introduced as the ideal-typical citizen, highlighting the importance
   of the energy transition, the agency of material structures and a new
   emergent governmentality. `Energy democracy' is conceptualized as an
   analytical and decision-making tool, defined along three dimensions:
   popular sovereignty, participatory governance and civic ownership, and
   operationalized with relevant indicators.},

Title = {Transitioning to a low carbon society through energy communities:
   Lessons learned from Brazil and Italy},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {New legal arrangements for the aggregation of distributed generation and
   demand are required for the future electricity grid so as to increase
   flexibility, resilience, citizens? participation and also alleviate
   energy poverty. To promote the transitioning to a low carbon society,
   countries are reforming their legal framework to enable broad civic
   engagement in the energy markets. This work analyses the process of
   reform of the legal framework of the electric sector with focus on
   energy communities, using two study cases, one in Brazil and another in
   Italy. The research performed is applied, qualitative, descriptive and
   exploratory. The work uses multiple research methods, blending case
   studies, semi-structured interviews and a systematic literature review
   for data collection and the functional method of comparative law,
   discourse analysis and triangulation for data analysis. The findings
   suggest greater consideration of the energy poverty nexus in the policy

Title = {Advocating a just transition in Appalachia: Civil society and industrial
   change in a carbon-intensive region},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Whereas research to date has focused on the role of governments and
   unions in leading just transition initiatives, this study explores the
   role of a broad range of civil society actors. It focuses on the central
   Appalachian region in the U.S. (Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia),
   which has significant fossil-fuel resources. Based on an analysis of 98
   initiatives related to a just transition led by 70 civil society
   organizations during the 2010-2020 period, the study contributes to the
   just transitions literature by showing the role of non-labor civil
   society in defining and motivating a just transition in the context of
   resistance from actors associated with fossil-fuel industries. The study
   develops a framework for researching just transitions that is based on
   two sets of goals: societal change (democracy and equity) and
   sociotechnical system change (support for renewable energy and energy
   efficiency and opposition to fossil-fuel extraction and pollution).
   Results from the comparative and network analyses indicate that the four
   goal types are not equally represented and that civil society
   organizations tend to specialize with respect to the goals, with only a
   few organizations providing bridges across the goals. Implications for
   strategy for funders and advocacy organizations are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper considers aspects of spatial justice in the processes of land
   acquisition for large-scale solar energy projects in the
   developmentalist context of India. It explores the case of one of the
   world's largest solar park projects in Charanka, Gujarat. While the
   official rhetoric suggests an inclusive project for globally benign
   renewable energy production, the research reveals a more controversial
   land and power politics of renewable energy. It is argued, in
   particular, that the project increases the precariousness of vulnerable
   communities, who are exposed to the loss of livelihoods due to the
   enclosure of common land and extra-legal mechanisms through which land
   acquisitions for the project have reportedly taken place. This case
   exemplifies how solar mega-projects may manifest a regime of
   accumulation whereby low carbon coalitions of interests can maximize
   their gains by dispossessing vulnerable social groups of their
   life-sustaining assets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {CLEAN ENERGY JUSTICE: CHARTING AN EMERGING AGENDA},
Journal = {HARVARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {307-371},
Abstract = {The rapid transition to clean energy is fraught with potential
   inequities. As clean energy policies ramp up in scale and ambition, they
   confront challenging new questions: Who should pay for the transition?
   Who should live next to the industrial-scale wind and solar farms these
   policies promote? Will the new ``green{''} economy be a fairer one, with
   more widespread opportunity, than the fossil fuel economy it is
   replacing? Who gets to decide what kinds of resources power our
   decarbonized world? In this article, we frame these challenges as part
   of an emerging agenda of ``clean energy justice.{''} Mapping this agenda
   highlights the equity challenges that will attend the transition to
   clean energy, and allows for more comprehensive, creative approaches to
   legal and policy solutions.
   A cleaner energy economy does not ineluctably translate into a more just
   economy. We identify four considerations that will be critical to ensure
   that clean energy does not entrench widening inequalities in wealth and
   power: (1) how to fund the transition; (2) who benefits from the upsides
   of the new clean energy economy, including green jobs and new
   technologies like rooftop solar panels; (3) who participates in
   decisions about the shape of the new clean energy economy; and (4) how
   and where new clean energy infrastructure is sited. Drawing from
   available data, we describe why there are real risks that the gains of
   clean energy might be unequally distributed, while the costs fall on
   rural communities and non-adopters of new technologies, thus
   exacerbating inequality while greening the grid. And through original
   empirical research, we highlight the challenges of full and equal
   participation in the esoteric, technocratic procedures of energy law.
   The present moment is a critical one for bringing these diverse
   considerations together into this overarching agenda. The U.S. energy
   system is in the early days of a long transition away from fossil fuels
   towards clean energy. It is time for energy lawmakers and energy law
   scholars to better anticipate the distributive and procedural justice
   concerns that will attend this transition, and to forge new ways to
   address them.},

Title = {Renewable energy communities as `socio-legal institutions': A normative
   frame for energy decentralization?},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although the need for energy decentralization and energy democratization
   has been discussed in the realms of academe for some time, the impact at
   policy level is yet to be seen. This is however with the notable
   exception, at the European level, of the Recast Renewable Energy
   Directive (RED-II) which aims in part to stimulate the formation of
   `renewable energy communities' in all the Member States. The
   implementation at policy level remains with Member States where national
   policies are still overwhelmingly centralised. This creates barriers to
   the decentralization and democratization of energy and, ultimately, to
   achieving a `just transition'. This article therefore proposes as a way
   forward to recognise such renewable energy communities as legal entities
   to be embedded within a separate socio-legal institution (of civil
   energy networks), to shape (a transition towards) a just new energy
   system. After explaining what form this new institutional environment
   and the communities within would take, this article analyses this
   proposition in the light of the twin aims of energy decentralization and
   democratization to see how such forms can help achieve energy justice.
   It is also explained why this can only work upon an institutionally
   normative alignment. Following an appreciation in the light of growing
   research of such forms in the Netherlands, the UK and further afield,
   there seems to be a strong case for the proposed model. Still,
   realization requires clear purposive legislative steps. Such steps can
   only lead to `on the ground' success with a coherent and
   multi-disciplinary institutional perspective. We aim for our research to
   provide a platform for such efforts.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {19-28},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years the term `energy democracy' has become increasingly
   popular, especially in the context of aspirations for a low-carbon
   transition that include wider socio-economic and political
   transformation. The emergence of `energy democracy' is thus part of a
   broader trend in research and practice which has sought to foreground
   the `stuff' of politics. Yet, unlike the more academically developed
   concepts of energy justice and energy citizenship, energy democracy is a
   concept that emerged largely from social movements. This has resulted in
   a body of literature with little connection to established academic
   debates and theories. The growing popularity of the concept calls for a
   critical evaluation of the term and how it is used. By reviewing
   existing energy democracy publications and bringing these in
   conversations with more theoretical literature, we are seeking to
   address four issues; the rationale for pursuing energy democracy, the
   people and stakeholders involved and excluded, the proposed material
   focus of energy democracy, and the geographical focus of energy
   democracy. In the subsequent discussion we draw connections between
   energy democracy, the growing body of social science energy research and
   political theory, and identify avenues for further research.},

Title = {Wonderland of technology? How energy landscapes reveal inequalities and
   injustices of the German Energiewende},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of what
   characterizes energy landscapes in general and to what extent they are
   an expression of social inequalities and injustices in the specific case
   of the German Energiewende. In the sense of a review, the central
   findings will be integrated into the spatial concept `production of
   space' by Henri Lefebvre. This is intended to uncover those social
   spaces that are produced by the powerful actors of the Energiewende and
   that become unequal and unjust energy landscapes on the basis of
   neoliberal spatial concepts. In addition, it is necessary to discuss a
   conceptual question that has hardly been considered so far: whether and
   how can energy landscapes be distinguished from other landscapes and
   where exactly should the lines of demarcation be drawn in the context of
   debates on energy justice? It is shown that spatial demarcation based on
   the representative, symbolic, discursive, and thus material-abstract
   phenomena of landscape is an appropriate way to understand the
   population's resistance to the dominant territorial-institutional
   structures of the Energiewende. The study concludes that the achievement
   of climate goals appears realistic if the production of sustainable
   energy landscapes is primarily understood as the production of a
   discourse about sustainability, equity, and justice.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the factors that motivate local energy production
   and transition and opposing lock-ins, within the context of urban
   municipal energy managment, in France. A new conceptual framework, local
   and domestic geopolitics, is mobilized to shed light on the
   conflictuality of this process, the political resources activated by
   local authorities in front of national operators, the links between
   energy control and power at the local level, ultimately refocusing
   questions of energy justice. We present an in-depth case study of the
   border city of Metz, which inherited a municipal energy company founded
   during the German annexation. It revealed the reasons and the means by
   which, since the beginning of the twentieth century, energy became a
   local resource and its production was expanded, in spite of a
   centralized energy system. Local energy was found to be a political
   construction, serving to reinforce local authority. In the context of
   energy transition, it is becoming a new energy resource, local actors
   intending it to progressively take the place of centralized energies, a
   focal point of a new geopolitics of energy. Within this geopolitical
   landscape, the power and benefits conferred by the control of energy
   production is found to be a central dimension of energy justice. In
   Metz, this power and benefits has not been better shared than at the
   national level, whether in procedural, distributive, or recognition
   terms, serving the career of a mayor and the local finances, rather than
   democratization of energy choices.},

Title = {Can Michigan's Upper Peninsula Achieve Justice in Transitioning to 100\%
   Renewable Electricity? Survey of Public Perceptions in Sociotechnical
   Change},

Abstract = {The cost of energy in the Western Upper Peninsula (WUP), a rural and
   northern part of the state of Michigan, is among the highest in the
   United States. This situation has resulted in hardship for WUP residents
   due to exorbitant electricity bills. While interest in renewable
   electricity (RE) has increased in the region, the unanswered questions
   are what factors would make WUP residents more or less supportive of a
   transition to 100\% RE, and how does the support for a 100\% RE
   transition differ between counties in the WUP? This research analyzed
   factors that would make residents more or less supportive of a 100\% RE
   transition in the WUP. This research investigated public perceptions
   through a quantitative residents' survey (N = 347). Using logistic
   regression, the results show that residents' likelihood to participate
   in a municipality-led initiative that will reduce their consumption by
   5\% is statistically significant to their probability of support for
   wind energy development at p < 0.05. Furthermore, the likelihood of
   100\% RE transition support is very high across WUP counties, with a
   similar trend for project preferences. The results in this research can
   provide a roadmap for future community-engaged planning on 100\% RE in
   various counties in the region.},

   context of pandemic: The socio-political diversity of preferences in
   energy and environmental policy},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article presents the results of research conducted on a
   representative sample of Polish society and concerning their attitudes
   towards energy policy, the role and importance of coal, the preferred
   energy model and the future of Upper Silesia, which is the largest
   active coal basin in Europe. The context of the COVID 19 pandemic, which
   caused high morbidity among miners, popularised the challenge of energy
   transition in Poland, where energy continues to be largely based on
   coal. The authors defend the thesis that the main lines of conflict
   regarding the demand to move away from coal are political and
   ideological at the level of public opinion. The advocates of the coal
   status quo are supporters of the right-wing populist Law and Justice
   (PiS) and Confederation (Konfederacja) parties. Left-wing and liberal
   groups are most conducive to energy transition and ecological demands.
   Residents of large cities, as well as better educated and less religious
   people are more open to energy transition. Despite the divisions
   regarding the date of abandoning coal in Poland, there is social
   agreement that the government should financially support the activities
   transforming Upper Silesia into a region producing clean energy.},

Abstract = {The implications of place attachment and loss in generational coal
   mining communities are currently under examined in energy transition
   discourse in Australia. By examining public submissions regarding a coal
   mining development in Lithgow, New South Wales, this paper identifies a
   relationship between coal mining and generational identity in this
   community. Acknowledging this relationship adds a useful perspective to
   energy transition discourse by highlighting the way in which hidden
   dimensions of loss can act to reinforce local support of extractive
   industry. We combine recent scholarship on the emotionality of the
   minescape (Ey \& Sherval, 2016; Ey et al., 2017) with work on the ways
   in which place attachment can translate to feelings of loss in response
   to material change (Adger et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2016; Tschakert
   et al., 2017) to suggest that factors of time and place can make
   community-level actors within the energy landscape either receptive, or
   resistant, to change. Applying this understanding to decarbonisation
   strategies can inform a more effective, and more just, energy transition
   in Australia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {731-755},
Abstract = {One of the causes of the increasing number of ecological distribution
   conflicts around the world is the changing metabolism of the economy in
   terms of growing flows of energy and materials. There are conflicts on
   resource extraction, transport and waste disposal. Therefore, there are
   many local complaints, as shown in the Atlas of Environmental Justice
   (EJatlas) and other inventories. And not only complaints; there are also
   many successful examples of stopping projects and developing
   alternatives, testifying to the existence of a rural and urban global
   movement for environmental justice. Moreover, since the 1980s and 1990s,
   this movement has developed a set of concepts and campaign slogans to
   describe and intervene in such conflicts. They include environmental
   racism, popular epidemiology, the environmentalism of the poor and the
   indigenous, biopiracy, tree plantations are not forests, the ecological
   debt, climate justice, food sovereignty, land grabbing and water
   justice, among other concepts. These terms were born from
   socio-environmental activism, but sometimes they have also been taken up
   by academic political ecologists and ecological economists who, for
   their part, have contributed other concepts to the global environmental
   justice movement, such as `ecologically unequal exchange' or the
   `ecological footprint'.},

Abstract = {The study aims to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
   threats (SWOT) of renewable energy deployment in regional energy
   transitions for the regions of Bavaria, Georgia, Quebec, Sao Paulo,
   Shandong, Upper Austria, and Western Cape, which comprise a political
   and scientific network called the Regional Leaders' Summit (RLS) and
   RLS-Sciences, respectively. The results classify current renewable
   energy usage for electricity, heat and fuel production, existing
   renewable energy potentials, sound legal frameworks to support renewable
   energy, ongoing research and development activities and expertise in
   renewable energy conversion and storage as strengths. That fossil fuels
   still hold a significant share in gross inland energy consumption,
   energy-intensive industrial structures continue to be supported by
   fossil fuels and grid access is limited for renewables are identified as
   weaknesses. The main opportunities are green economies, climate change
   mitigation and technological innovations. Associated threats are
   demographic developments, lack of social acceptance and renewable energy
   resource volatility. We conclude that these regions' energy systems
   could potentially enable the realization of a strong integration of
   renewables and cover partially distributed, decentralized energy systems
   with embedded energy storage, and the application of smart technologies.
   Furthermore, we discover that the role of governments in guiding and
   managing regional energy transitions is highly important.},

   Communities-Towards an Inclusive Design of the Clean Energy Package},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The unequal distribution of costs and benefits of the energy transition
   is a challenge for energy justice and energy policy. Although the
   empowerment of consumers to participate in renewable energy communities
   (RECs) has great potential for a just energy transition, vulnerable
   consumers remain underrepresented in RE projects. The recast of the
   European renewable energy directive obliges the European Member States
   to facilitate the participation of vulnerable consumers and support
   their inclusion in its ``enabling framework{''} for prosumership.
   However, the type and specific design of corresponding measures remains
   unclear. Against this background this article investigates consumer
   empowerment in a vulnerability context. In particular we stress the need
   to understand how vulnerability affects participation in RECs to inform
   both policy makers and practitioners on its specificities and
   restrictions for the ``enabling framework{''}. To prevent the inclusion
   of vulnerable consumers in RECs from remaining an idea on paper
   lawmakers need to be made aware of the implications for a consistent
   ``enabling framework{''}. We argue that both individual vulnerable
   consumers as well as RECs need incentives and support to boost RECs'
   capacity to include groups that until now remain underrepresented.},

Title = {Who are the victims of low-carbon transitions? Towards a political
   ecology of climate change mitigation},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study critically examines 20 years of geography and political
   ecology literature on the energy justice implications of climate change
   mitigation. Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198
   studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the
   linkages between low carbon transitions-including renewable electricity,
   biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use
   management-with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on
   a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon
   transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture
   of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment
   (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of
   inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how
   these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of
   mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and
   by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence,
   murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the
   destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the
   locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of
   analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling
   insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and
   energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future
   research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative
   analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies,
   multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At
   times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor
   over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers,
   scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake.
   Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon
   world more pluralistic, democratic, and just.},

Title = {A just transition for whom? Politics, contestation, and social identity
   in the disruption of coal in the Powder River Basin},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Substantially decreasing carbon emissions is both necessary to stave off
   the worst impacts of climate change and also certain to result in a loss
   of jobs and revenue for fossil fuel communities and workers. Just
   transition policies aim to mitigate these losses and provide an
   equitable transition away from fossil fuel extraction and use. Yet, just
   transition is often contested in the regions the policies are meant to
   aid. This paper presents a case study of the Powder River Basin,
   Wyoming, the largest coal mining region in the U.S where the energy
   transition is deeply contested. In the summer of 2019, two large coal
   mines suddenly and unexpectedly shut down. The research conducted
   explored whether this sudden change in conditions changed perceptions
   toward the energy transition or just transition polices based on
   interviews with decision makers, environmental advocates, coal industry
   officials, and union officials. I find that the energy transition and
   just transition remains deeply contested and opposed, even after the
   sudden closure of the mines, indicating that transition may always be
   contested due to the long-standing role coal has played in the region.
   Despite opposition and efforts to prolong the life of the coal industry,
   an energy transition is occurring and a government-led managed decline
   with just transition policies is the best way to prevent severe economic
   distress in the region.},

Title = {Just Transitions: A Political Ecology Critique},
Journal = {ANTIPODE},
Abstract = {``Green deals{''} to promote socially inclusive decarbonisation have
   captured the imagination of public intellectuals and advocates across
   the political spectrum. Such programmes are often premised upon the
   concept of ``just transitions{''}, which aims to reconcile environmental
   and social concerns in the movement towards a low-carbon future. I
   respond to some of the underlying tensions that underpin dominant
   discourses in this domain by foregrounding collective, disruptive, and
   non-capitalist forms of infrastructural transformation in the energy
   domain. I discuss possibilities for a more egalitarian politics and
   shared environmental commons in the articulation of residential energy
   efficiency and housing upgrades with the aid of insights from the
   political ecology literature, and examples from activist praxis across
   Europe and North America. More broadly, I highlight how well-known
   contradictions of labour, environmental sustainability, and economic
   transformation are complicated by encounters with climate and energy
   circulations.},

Title = {Sustainability and social justice dimension indicators for applied
   renewable energy research: A responsible approach proposal},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {252},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Aspects of sustainability and social justice deserve special attention
   in the research and innovation landscape in Europe. In this vein, the
   inclusion of innovative research and innovation policies, such as
   Responsible Research and Innovation, devoted to mainstream social
   outcomes, to deploy democratic governance of science, and to drive
   innovation into a direction that is ethically acceptable, societally
   desirable and sustainable are noteworthy. However, substantial efforts
   are required when it comes to integrate the interactions between
   renewable energy research and energy and climate policies within
   responsible approaches. In order to adapt responsible research and
   innovation approach for the purpose of building an alternative context
   and assessment approach for sustainable transitions, this paper presents
   a review of approaches around sustainability and social justice
   dimensions. The thresholds of this endeavour are detailed in terms of
   the challenges for the integration, the identification of the inhibitors
   and facilitators of policy integration and the proposal of the levels
   for a methodology for this integration. The results show that the
   different readings and understanding of the contexts and dimensions and
   the existence of knowledge gaps between policy targets and the outcomes
   of research and innovation can be considered inhibitors for the
   integration. In contrast the interlinks between dimensional concepts,
   backgrounds and rationales appear as facilitators. The innovative
   contribution of this paper is focused on the contextualization of the
   dimensions through the use of socio-technical and multi/inter/trans and
   cross-disciplinary approaches. The authors conclude that the process of
   introducing a more holistic and alternative approach opens the
   re-envision of policy elements. Moreover, RRI offers an innovative
   perspective to the transition approach as well as tools for
   decision-making and policy processes assessment, in an arena where
   constant innovation is taking place and new structures, processes and
   metrics are necessary to guide this process.},

Abstract = {We add to the emerging body of literature highlighting cracks in the

   technologies, and suggests alternative solutions that entail a
   contraction of the human enterprise. This analysis makes clear that the
   pat notion of ``affordable clean energy{''} views the world through a
   narrow keyhole that is blind to innumerable economic, ecological, and
   social costs. These undesirable ``externalities{''} can no longer be
   ignored. To achieve sustainability and salvage civilization, society
   must embark on a planned, cooperative descent from an extreme state of
   overshoot in just a decade or two. While it might be easier for the
   proverbial camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for global
   society to succeed in this endeavor, history is replete with stellar
   achievements that have arisen only from a dogged pursuit of the

Title = {Quantifying international energy justice: The cost of electricity within
   footprint accounts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {341},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {This research quantifies the international electric payments embodied in
   goods and services, for the purpose of moving towards a clear and fair
   electric exchange within international footprint accounts. The electric
   consumption and related cost of 43 countries that represent 84\% of
   global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been calculated, shifting from
   traditionally used Production-Based Accounting (PBA) to
   Consumption-Based Accounting (CBA). This research has identified not
   only the electric cost for what is produced in each country, but also
   the electric cost embodied in imported and exported goods and services.
   The difference between Production-and Consumption-Based Accounts has
   been defined as ``Hidden Electric Cost{''} (HEC). Secondly, we have
   calculated the hypothetical national electric cost if countries were to
   produce within their own borders all the goods and services they
   consume. The difference between the current electric footprint cost and
   hypothetical self-sufficiency cost has been referred to as ``Justice in
   Electricity Costs{''} (JIEC), an indicator which shows how much a
   country would have to spend to achieve electric sovereignty. This
   indicator reveals that there are countries (usually developed ones) that
   would face greater costs than what they currently pay by outsourcing the
   production of goods to other less developed countries. The study shows
   that, from the 43 countries analysed, and the Rest of the World (RoW)
   considered a 44th one, the ten most developed ones are spending on
   average 14.36\% more on electricity than declared, and the ten least
   developed ones, 1.35\% less than declared. At the same time, the 10 most
   developed countries would have to spend even 0.86\% more to achieve
   electrical sovereignty, while for the ten least developed countries this
   would mean savings of 1.04\%. In addition, a more specific analysis has
   been made for the textile and agriculture sectors, showing the ten
   countries with the highest Human Development Index (HDI) among those
   analysed would have to spend 438.75\% more on average to pay for
   imported electricity at national price and achieve electric sovereignty
   for the textile sector, and 24.4\% more for the agriculture sector. In
   the interests of achieving fair global electric payments, it would be
   appropriate for countries to take these variations in payments into
   account in international relations so as to move towards greater
   international justice.},

   projects in Mexico},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Social opposition to renewable energy (RE) projects has become a
   significant issue both for the deployment of RE technologies and the
   social justice of this process. However, the policy tools oriented to
   address this issue have received little research attention, particularly
   in the Global South. Thus, this research analyses the effectiveness of
   the social impact assessment (SIA) in Mexico's RE sector. In 2014 the
   government of Mexico introduced the SIA in response to the social
   conflicts around RE projects. The SIA has generated some favorable
   changes in the sector's social management. Yet, its effectiveness is
   constrained by diverse issues related to its institutional and
   regulatory design, government implementation, practices of companies and
   consultants, and restricted social involvement. Moreover, the sector's
   socio-technical arrangement (priorities, organization, experience, and
   policies) strongly influences the performance of SIAs and accounts for
   the lack of consideration of social aspects in project design and
   planning. We argue that without a substantial internalization of the
   social dimension in the priorities, policy, and planning of RE, the SIA
   would be limited to a problem-fixing role, which would constrain the
   effective management of social impacts.},

Title = {Challenging dominant sustainability worldviews on the energy transition:
   Lessons from Indigenous communities in Mexico and a plea for pluriversal
   technologies},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {150},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Little research exists on how alternative understandings of
   sustainability and societal well-being, such as those developed by
   marginalized Indigenous populations, can enrich and possibly challenge
   dominant visions of sustainability anchored in Western discourses on
   sustainable development and ecological modernization. This paper
   addresses this research gap in the context of the transition towards
   low-carbon energy sources by addressing the following question: how do
   Indigenous worldviews contrast with modernist visions of sustainability
   in the context of the energy transition? To do so, it first builds a
   conceptual framework contrasting modernist and Indigenous sustainability
   worldviews. Second, it applies this framework to the case of wind energy
   developments within the territory of three Zapotec communities located
   in southern Mexico, with the discussion relying on 103 interviews with
   key stakeholders, six focus groups and participant observation. Results
   show that the Zapotec sustainability worldview contrasts strikingly with
   wind developers' modernist propositions, which tend to reproduce the
   region's past colonial arrangements in terms of cultural domination,
   non-recognition of Indigenous identities and disrespect for local
   customs. This contrast has led to many conflicts and misunderstandings
   around wind energy projects. The paper concludes that different
   conceptualizations of sustainability must be recognized to ensure an
   inclusive and just energy transition, and advances the concept of
   ``pluriversal technologies{''} to emphasize the need for technologies
   that embrace ontological and epistemological diversity by being
   co-designed, co-produced and co-owned by the inhabitants of the
   socio-cultural territory in which they are embedded. (c) 2021 The

Title = {Explaining regional acceptance of the German energy transition by
   including trust in stakeholders and perception of fairness as
   socio-institutional factors},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},
Number = {SI},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper we pursue the hypothesis that acceptance of the energy
   transition is not merely determined by technology acceptance but also by
   the perception of socio-institutional stakeholders and the perception of
   fairness. We test an acceptance model which includes the following main
   predictors: attitudes towards the risks of the energy transition and
   attitudes towards the technology options such as wind power,
   photovoltaic systems or transmission lines. Additional influences are
   assumed to arise from the perception of regional added values and the
   trust in various socio-institutional stakeholders. Furthermore, we
   expect fairness to be a mediating variable for acceptance. In this paper
   we test the model empirically with a representative German sample (N =
   2009) in a structural equation model (SEM) for the acceptance of onshore
   wind power. Moreover, we analyse whether differences in the factors are
   related to the German regions North, East, West and South since we
   assume regional landscapes, renewable energy sources and socio-political
   contexts to be important for acceptance. Results show evidence that
   perception of stakeholders and fairness is important for the regional
   acceptance. In addition, results show that, among the four regions,
   different factors are relevant for acceptance. Results are discussed and
   conclusions for governance are drawn.},

Title = {``Power farmers{''} in north India and new energy producers around the
   world: Three critical fields for multiscalar research},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An increasing number of people around the world are directly involved in
   the financing and work of energy production through practices such as
   decentralized generation, re-scaled resource extraction, and energy
   localization. Many of these new energy producers are farmers seeking to
   diversify their income streams - raising questions about land-use,
   labour, and livelihoods that cut across multiple spatial and temporal
   scales. Such complex, multiscalar dynamics push at the boundaries of
   contemporary energy research and require researchers to engage in the
   ongoing development of critical and holistic analytical approaches.
   Contributing to those efforts, and reporting on solar initiatives
   including the state-led Power Farmers program in northern India - a
   country where `solar farming' occupies a central position in national
   energy policy - this article calls for energy research to apply insights
   from three related fields of action and analysis: food sovereignty,
   eco-swaraj (or Radical Ecological Democracy), and critical environmental
   justice. Scrutinizing interrelated issues of power and autonomy,
   inequality, and ecological regeneration, the three fields offer vital
   tools for future research on new energy producers and for social
   struggles that confront emergent energy justice concerns.},

Title = {Three sides to every story: Gender perspectives in energy transition
   pathways in Canada, Kenya and Spain},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Transitions toward a low-carbon future are not only technical and
   economical, but also deeply social and gendered. The gendered nature of
   energy transitions is often implicit and unexplored. As a corrective,
   this paper explores energy pathways by applying concepts from
   innovations and gender studies. We examine gender perspectives and niche
   energy innovations which could disrupt the regime. The regime represents
   the mainstream pathway that includes the dominant gender perspective and
   energy system. We explore different gender perspectives of energy
   transition pathways by applying an Alternative Pathways framework that
   includes: (1) on stream pathways that exist within the mainstream
   pathway to promote equal opportunities for women and men, as well as
   niches for energy innovations without challenging the high-carbon energy
   regime; (2) off-stream pathways that depart from the mainstream and
   promote differences across different genders while creating niches
   outside the energy regime; and (3) transformative pathways that are
   fundamentally different from the previous mainstream and includes all
   gender perspectives in a new energy regime. Applying this framing, in
   Canada, we explored Indigenous perspectives in the oil sands sector; in
   Kenya, we studied largescale renewable energy impacting Indigneous
   communities; in Spain, we evaluate the movement away from fossil fuels
   and towards renewable technologies. The framework helped to identify
   that mainstream pathways represented the dominant male perspective while
   woman's perspective were largely left out. Such absence generate energy
   pathways that are disconnected from local realities, lack public buy-in
   and slow-down a sustainable energy transition.},

Title = {How modern are renewables? The misrecognition of traditional solar
   thermal energy in Peru's energy transition},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ubiquitous claim for `modern' energy access leads to profound
   transformative dynamics in energy systems in the global South. However,
   the policies' effects on existing socio-technical forms of energy
   provision must be considered. In this paper, we highlight the case of
   Peru, where the `modernisation' of the energy systems endangers an
   established practice of renewable energy use. In the city of Arequipa,
   households widely rely on solar water heaters that have been
   manufactured locally since the 1930s. Applying an institutionalist
   approach, we analyse actors and institutions of this local energy
   system. We identify a disconnection of existing renewable energy
   practices from national policies and their marginalisation by
   international cooperation agencies. We show how the misrecognition
   jeopardises the livelihood of people involved and provokes the loss of
   contextualised innovation potentials. Thus, we discover a dichotomy of
   `modern' energy policies and `traditional' practices of solar thermal
   energy. Based on this case study, we therefore stress the need to
   include local energy practices into the energy policy framework for
   ensuring technological and social gains. We also emphasise the need to
   generally shift away from a top-down approach with generalised globally
   applicable solutions to more inclusive governance and policy
   formulation.},

Title = {Just energy transitions to low carbon economies: A review of the concept
   and its effects on labour and income},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The global environmental and social crisis has motivated the renaissance
   of just transitions, this time centred around the effects on labour and
   income distribution of the shift to a sustainable energy mix. This
   renewed conception has gone beyond its origins in the US unions in the
   1970s to become a key element in many discourses worldwide, with
   different nuances. Over the last few years, it has found a place in the
   SDGs and gathered strong support from the ILO. As political frameworks
   and literature multiply, this work presents a systematic review of the
   concept, its evolution and the methodologies devoted to studying it. We
   make three major points. First, the empirical state-of-the-art has
   blurred the lines of the methodological classifications found in
   previous studies: CGE and IAMs are two of the most popular methods, with
   a growing interest in hybrid approaches and system dynamics.
   Additionally, while most studies focus on the national level, the
   regional level is gaining momentum to illustrate the asymmetric effects
   of the transition. Second, a certain consensus has been detected to
   point out a positive, yet relatively small, impact of the transition on
   net employment and a negative effect on income distribution. Third,
   there is a scarcity of research about income dynamics, while studies on
   labour are blind to the effects of the transition on the quality of
   jobs, the evolution of working hours and gender. These gaps have
   inspired the elaboration of a research agenda that is presented at the
   end of the work.},

Title = {Community Energy Companies in the UK: A Potential Model for Sustainable
   Development in ``Local{''} Energy?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The rise of renewable energy sources (RES) comes with a shift in
   attention from government and market energy governance to local
   community initiatives and self-regulation. Although this shift is
   generally welcome at domestic and EU level, the regulatory dimension, at
   both levels, is nevertheless not adapted to this multi-actor market
   since prosumers are not empowered and energy justice is far from
   achieved. The rise, in the UK, of Community Interest Companies
   (consumers and local actors' collectives) in the energy sector provides
   an interesting perspective as it allows a whole system's view. Research
   was conducted with six energy community organizations in the South West
   of England in order to evaluate their role and identity and assess
   whether this exemplar of ``the rise of a social sphere in regulation{''}
   could be used as a model for a more sustainable social approach to the
   governance of economic relations. Findings illustrate that such
   organizations undoubtedly play an important role in the renewable energy
   sector and they also help to alleviate some aspects of ``energy
   injustice{''}. Yet, the failure to recognize, in terms of energy policy,
   at domestic and EU level, the importance of such actors undermines their
   role. The need to embed and support such organizations in policy is
   necessary if one is to succeed to put justice at the core of the
   changing energy landscape.},

Title = {Hydrogen for all? Household energy vulnerability and the transition to
   hydrogen in Australia},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Energy supply side policy in Australia currently advocates a role for
   hydrogen as a key part of decarbonising gas, including in the
   residential sector. However, there has been little focus to date on
   demand side issues and, in particular, the impact of a transition to
   hydrogen on vulnerable consumers. Vulnerability in the energy sector is
   the result of a complex interplay of structural and individual factors,
   and there is growing cross-sectoral concern that without careful
   consideration, existing vulnerabilities may be exacerbated in the
   low-carbon energy transition. While energy vulnerability in the
   decarbonisation of electricity has received attention, limited research
   exists on the potential impacts of a transition to hydrogen fuel in the
   domestic sector for consumers. At a national level there are plans, and
   pilot projects underway, to inject hydrogen into domestic natural gas
   supplies, beginning with low percentage blends of hydrogen and moving
   towards 100\% hydrogen ultimately produced by renewable energy. This
   project investigated what is currently known, and what still needs to be
   known, about the potential impacts of decarbonising Australia's
   residential gas with hydrogen on energy vulnerability, drawing on
   existing literature and key stakeholder views from the energy industry,
   government and social advocacy groups. The findings from this
   preliminary study reveal critical knowledge gaps in the field which must
   be addressed if an equitable transition to low-carbon gaseous fuels in
   Australia's residential sector is to be achieved. Five research options
   are made to help fill these knowledge gaps.},

Title = {Re-presenting the rural in the UK press: An exploration of the
   construction, contestation and negotiation of media discourses on the
   rural within post-carbon energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Governments worldwide are promoting the deployment of low-carbon energy
   generation and associated infrastructures, such as wind farms and high
   voltage power lines. These are mainly large-scale and built in rural
   areas, where more space and resources are available. When specific
   infrastructures are constructed in rural places, opposition is often
   found, namely from the local communities living nearby, revealing how
   energy transitions create socio-spatial justice conflicts. Social
   sciences' research on energy transitions and rural studies have been
   increasingly highlighting how diverse imaginaries of the rural are
   mobilized in siting disputes, by community members and developers alike,
   either to contest the deployment of energy infrastructures or to promote
   them. However, an examination of the role of the media - an important
   actor reflecting and shaping public opinion - in re-presenting the rural
   in relation to energy transitions has been largely overlooked so far.
   This paper analyses UK newspapers' (Guardian, Times, Sun) discourses on
   the rural within post-carbon energy transitions, in the period from 2008
   (pre-Renewables Directive 2009) to 2014. Based on these analyses, the
   role of new energy landscapes in (re-)interpretations of rurality and
   the role of these in post-carbon energy transitions will be discussed.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {Cultural diversity is increasing in the US, which is likely to have an
   impact on preferences toward future energy policy.
   This research investigates people's lived experience and preferences
   through a nationally representative survey (n = 3000) regarding the
   energy system, and how these relate to cultural group and other
   demographics.
   Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the US,
   alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward
   the energy system and energy policy.
   Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural
   groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived
   experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy
   affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational
   achievement.
   For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive
   link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural
   grouping.
   Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian
   and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and
   energy system factors compared to their peers.
   Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes
   to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment,
   and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences
   to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition
   justice outcomes.},

Title = {What is prosumerism for? Exploring the normative dimensions of
   decentralised energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Energy systems are in transformation towards increasingly renewable,
   decentralised, demand responsive and smart configurations. This has led
   to advocacy of the `prosumer' phenomenon: characterised by actors who
   both consume and produce renewable energy. In parallel a range of
   prosumer business models are emerging, governed by a range of market,
   municipal and community actors. Through a series of semi-structured
   interviews, focus groups and documentary analysis - centred on a case
   study of Bristol in the UK - this paper critically evaluates the
   normative dimensions of prosumer business models, modes of governance
   and understandings of value. We discuss how competing `value logics' are
   present within imagined futures of prosumerism, and through a novel
   conceptual framework, how these modes of governance may lead to
   divergent material outcomes in a decentralised energy transition. We
   argue that a more explicit recognition of competing theories of value,
   agency and change is needed in future discussions of prosumerism.},

Title = {The governance of Peruvian energy transitions: Path dependence,
   alternative ideas and change in national hydropower expansion},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Drawing from work on governance, this article stresses the role of
   different contexts for energy transitions and focuses on the particular
   conditions in expanding energy systems. The definition of expanding
   energy systems is introduced to avoid short-hand classifications such as
   developed and developing countries, and instead to differentiate based
   on the characteristics of the energy system itself. Furthermore, this
   article explores the implications of energy expansion for change and
   continuity in energy systems using the example of large-scale hydropower
   development in the Maranon River, Peru. Based on qualitative social
   research, this article shows that the analysed expansion of hydropower
   relies on the consolidated extractivist development model and stands for
   continuity; however, it also evinces that a diverse opposition of state
   authorities and civil society is willing to take an active part in
   decisions on the future energy system causing change. The article
   concludes that the expansion of energy generation is a window of
   opportunity for change in energy systems and provides suggestions on how
   to rethink governance. Finally, the article recommends further advancing
   the conceptualisation of transitions in expanding energy systems.},

   towards achieving the global goal of zero net emissions. The speaker
   also highlights the severe and ongoing ecological damage and human
   suffering caused by the failure to reduce emissions with sufficient
   urgency in the first quarter of the 21st Century - and the ongoing
   challenge of implementing the actions required to bring global
   temperatures back below 1.5 degrees.
   The speech identifies the following key drivers of the `great 21st
   century energy transition'.
   i) Sustained leadership from national and sub-national governments,
   business, civil society and the military in ratcheting up and
   accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement.
   ii) The escalating frequency and severity of catastrophic climatic
   events.
   iii) Disruptive, game changing technological innovation including in
   energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage and distribution,
   transport, construction and agriculture.
   iv) Disruptive, game changing innovation in social, economic and
   political institutions and relationships including:
   increasing recognition of the importance of reducing the global
   consumption of goods and services;
   an ongoing shift towards more distributed and collaborative economic
   paradigms and systems;
   growing popular and political support for the global climate justice
   movement;
   radical improvements in the transparency and accountability of
   democratic and governance processes; and
   the mobilization of millions of citizens driving transformational change
   in investment flows, electoral outcomes and political choices.},

Title = {`Renewables? Yes, please!': perceptions and assessment of community
   transition induced by renewable-energy projects in North Frisia},

Abstract = {A renewable-energy transition evokes the question `Renewables? Yes,
   please!' or `Renewables? No, thanks!' to people, communities and
   regions, because it initiates a physical and social transition to places
   and communities. Although `community renewable energy' emerged as a
   grassroots-based innovation and is thus of increasing interest to the
   public and politicians, actual interwoven community benefits and
   challenges of renewable-energy projects are not well understood yet.
   Recent studies mainly consider potential community benefits and not
   experienced benefits and hardly address challenges which affected
   communities face. To address this research gap, we empirically
   investigated how people perceive community-based renewables and assess
   the change in the social fabric of communities, the so named `community
   transition' resulting as outcome of local energy transition. We explored
   trade-offs between benefits and challenges by conducting a regional
   literature analysis, two sets of interviews in municipalities of North
   Frisia (Germany) and a household survey in one of them. Our results lead
   to two important insights: First, community renewables provide
   interwoven and offsetting physical, environmental, social, economic,
   planning and political benefits and challenges for communities. Second,
   a local participatory process and a fair distribution of revenues are
   essential for the success of community benefits, holding the potential
   for a sustainable development in rural areas. Thus, multifaceted and
   interlinked local benefits but also challenges of local energy
   transition need to be addressed more by developers and political
   decision-makers in order to enable and retain positive, sustainable
   outcomes of community renewable-energy projects.},

Title = {Moral rifts in the coal phase-out-how mayors shape distributive and
   recognition-based dimensions of a just transition in Lusatia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {Transitions towards low-carbon societies trigger renegotiations of
   justice concerns in regions that have to abandon unsustainable,
   fossil-based production patterns. In these transition regions, tensions
   may appear between inner- and supra-regional justice claims on the one
   hand, and recognition-based and distributional justice concerns on the
   other. Intermediary actors such as municipal politicians have to
   navigate these spatial and moral tensions. Based on qualitative data
   generated in the German lignite-mining region of Lusatia, `moral rifts'
   are reconstructed that shape local perceptions of justice. These rifts
   help elucidate how reconciliation in this region proves to be difficult
   despite considerable redistributive efforts. Unless patterns of
   misrecognition are adequately addressed, prospects for a successful
   transformation of the region remain limited.},

Abstract = {In today's populist moment, climate change response has become anything
   but ``postpolitical.{''} The project to decarbonize energy supplies is
   generating ongoing political clashes today, including between competing
   forms of capital/ism. In the United States, rising renewable energy
   industries in places like California contend with fossil fuel blocs and
   their regional bases. Such confrontations are sparking populist
   organizing on the right and left. I argue that critical geography must
   further consider left populist movements' role in these politics of
   clean energy transition, grievance, and reparation and openings for
   collectively advancing more liberatory futures. I survey a wave of
   coalition-building that has evolved in the United States since the
   beginnings of the New Economy, allying U.S. environmentalists, organized
   labor, and, more recently, racial and community justice organizers. This
   movement became most visible as it built networks around calls for
   national ``green collar{''} job creation during the late 2000s financial
   crisis and 2008 presidential campaign. Its organizing shaped noteworthy,
   if ultimately limited Obama administration programs and continues to
   influence clean energy rollout in regions such as California,
   particularly campaigns for job quality and racial diversity in green
   construction. I consider here both these successes and their limits in a
   turbulent clean-tech sector: the need for farther reaching
   transformations in energy-industrial policy and democratic participation
   in shaping them.},

Abstract = {Solar energy rollout has environmental and socio-economic impacts vital
   for just low-carbon energy transitions. The modular characteristics of
   solar photovoltaics enable multi-scalar deployment. How do environmental
   and socio-economic impacts vary across scales? This understudied
   relationship impacts the socio-spatiality of solar rollout, who
   benefits, and how this is enabled. Our study in Portugal during
   2017-2020 examines how solar energy went from subsidies to
   record-setting competitiveness. Most new solar capacity was large scale,
   with barriers for community energy that weakened in 2020. We draw on
   interviews with 80 experts and a small-scale questionnaire survey with
   solar energy cooperative members. Findings show large-scale solar
   rollout primarily yielded environmental benefits, whereas small scale
   yielded socio-economic benefits. We argue that near-future joined-up
   solar energy policies can facilitate synergistic interactions across
   three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by integrating
   environmental and socio-economic impacts. This main contribution can
   inform Portuguese and wider energy policies for sectoral development
   toward sustainability.},

Title = {Dispossessed by decarbonisation: Reducing vulnerability, injustice, and
   inequality in the lived experience of low-carbon pathways},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study examines the justice and equity implications of four
   low-carbon transitions, and it reveals the ``lived experiences{''} of
   decarbonisation as manifested across Africa and Europe. Based on
   extensive, orig-inal mixed methods empirical research - including expert
   interviews, focus groups, internet forums, community interviews, and
   extended site visits and naturalistic observation - it asks: How are
   four specific decarbonisation pathways linked to negative impacts within
   specific communities? Relatedly, what vulnerabilities do these
   transitions exacerbate in these communities? Lastly, how can such
   vulnerabilities be better addressed with policy? The paper documents a
   troublesome cohabitation between French wineries and nuclear power, the
   negative effects on labor groups and workers in Eastern Germany by a
   transition to solar energy, the stark embodied externalities in
   electronic waste (e-waste) flows from smart meters accumulating in
   Ghana, and the precarious exploitation of children involved in cobalt
   mining for electric vehicle batteries in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo. The aims and objectives of the study are threefold: (1) to
   showcase how four very different vulnerable communities have been
   affected by the negative impacts of decarbonisation; (2) to reveal
   tensions and tradeoffs between European transitions and local and global
   justice concerns; and (3) to inform energy and climate policy. In
   identifying these objectives, our goal is not to stop or slow down all
   low-carbon transitions. Rather, the study suggests that the research and
   policy communities ought to account for, and seek to minimize, a broader
   range of social and environmental sustainability risks. Sustainability
   transitions and decarbonisation pathways must become more egalitarian,
   fair, and just. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The academic interpretation of the concept of just transitions has
   evolved considerably over the last two decades. What was generally
   addressed in academic research in a technocratic way, with a primary
   focus on job replacement and the costs thereof, has given way to broader
   societal thinking around the need to address injustice in legacy energy
   systems. Research produced by advocacy organizations and the lay-press
   has been especially practical with respect to policy recommendations;
   yet, the social-economic interactions of fossil energy in specific
   communities are not well studied or understood. Thus, when legacy fossil
   communities are disrupted as part of the energy transition, society
   lacks the understanding necessary for immediate, effective policy
   decisions about how to best respond. Here, we argue that further tools
   based in inter-disciplinary science, social science, and humanities
   approaches need to be adopted to evaluate communities' experiences with
   transitions and to better design and implement policy and regulation.},

Title = {Not paid to dance at the powwow: Power relations, community benefits,
   and wind energy in M'Chigeeng First Nation, Ontario, Canada},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The literature on wind energy developments upholds distributional and
   procedural justice as key drivers of community acceptance of wind
   turbines. However, this Eurocentric and settler-based literature
   routinely overlooks Indigenous contexts, causing concern that the energy
   transition might reproduce the socio-economic inequalities of the fossil
   fuel era. Through 32 semi-structured interviews conducted within a
   community-based approach, this paper examines the lived experience of
   people living with wind turbines in M'Chigeeng First Nation in Ontario,
   an Indigenous community who owns and operates two wind turbines. We
   examine what the turbines mean to M'Chigeeng members, how owning the
   turbines relates to the community's values and goals, and to which
   extent M'Chigeeng's engagement in renewable energy portends a
   redefinition of relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
   people in Canada. The key themes in our findings are acceptance and
   support of the turbines, intra community communication, the importance
   of ownership, and relationships. While members expressed the need for
   clear and up-to-date communication on the project and are yet to see the
   generated financial benefits, intracommunity tensions remain manageable
   for the time being, tempered by a general pride from owning the
   turbines. Connecting relationships to restorative justice and
   recognition justice, we argue that these latter dimensions are equally,
   if not more meaningful, than procedural and distributional justice for
   understanding the meaning of turbines in M'Chigeeng First Nation. This
   study reaffirms the importance of attending to place histories at the
   broadest scale in examining communities' responses to renewable energy,
   especially in settler countries like Canada.},

Abstract = {The U.S. coal industry has experienced economic decline over the past
   several decades, which has resulted in a loss of mining jobs and severe
   economic hardship in many coal communities. Recent efforts to relax
   environmental regulations are ostensibly intended to help relieve this
   hardship and to revitalize this industry. Based on evidence gathered
   from focus groups and interviews conducted in U.S. coal communities, we
   argue that coal communities that have experienced mine closures have
   already begun an economic and social transition, one that is based on
   reshaping their culture and sense of identity, and false promises to
   return coal jobs can be destructive to the progress that has been made.},

Title = {A review of dominant sustainable energy narratives},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The global energy system is presently unsustainable and, even worse, is
   on a trajectory moving away from becoming sustainable. Thus, changing
   the present energy system is crucial, and importantly, it is also a
   prerequisite for achieving most of the UN's Sustainable Development
   Goals. We argue that we need sustainable energy narratives to show how
   we can move towards achieving a sustainable energy system. These
   narratives are important because they form and legitimize policy and
   behaviour and can create the necessary momentum for political movement
   and behavioural change. We present 13 dominant sustainable energy
   narratives that frequently appear in the scientific literature and have
   the potential to change the current unsustainable trajectory. The
   narratives-which can be complementary, competing, or substitutional-fall
   into three groups. The first group addresses how to satisfy human needs,
   the second addresses how to ensure social justice, and the third
   addresses how to respect environmental limits. Narratives from all three
   groups are needed to achieve a sustainable energy system. We also
   discuss avenues for further research, including downscaling the dominant
   narratives to local narratives, analysing the interactions among
   narratives, creating meta-narratives, and incorporating the narratives
   into the literature on the transition to a sustainable energy system.},

Abstract = {Climate policies in the European Union require a substantial reduction
   in carbon emissions from road transport. However, in the last decades
   the system of automobility has expanded considerably, establishing a
   process of path dependence that is very difficult to reverse. Changes in
   current patterns of automobility may increase oil vulnerability of
   citizens dependent on the use of the car, aggravating forms of social
   inequity. Based on an analysis of how television news framed a period of
   oil price rises in a country highly dependent on car use, the article
   shows that oil vulnerability may resonate with socially shared
   sociocultural meanings such as lack of trust in political leaders, which
   may aggravate the social perception of unfairness and compromise public
   support for energy transitions toward sustainability.},

Journal = {NATURE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1188+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Designing environmental policy to take account of social difference is
   increasingly recognized as essential to address both effectiveness and
   justice concerns. So far there is limited research on the experiences of
   disabled people in the environmental literature, amounting to a failure
   to recognize this substantial constituency. Here we compare disabled
   households' embodied energy use, income, risk of poverty and energy
   poverty, and other socio-demographics with other households in the
   European Union. We find that households including an economically
   inactive disabled person earn less and consume 10\% less energy than
   other households, and are more likely to experience energy poverty.
   Disabled households have lower consumption than other households in most
   categories, with the exception of basic consumption such as food, energy
   at home (gas and electricity), water and waste services: in effect they
   have less-and sometimes inadequate-access to resources. We conclude that
   more attention should be paid to disabled households needs to ensure a
   just energy transition.
   A just energy transition requires consideration of the needs of all
   people, yet disabled people are often overlooked. Ivanova and Middlemiss
   analyse the energy use of disabled households in the European Union,
   finding that on average they consume less energy and are more likely to
   experience energy poverty.},

Abstract = {Wind power is expanding globally. Simultaneously, a growing number of
   conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple
   locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions
   arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy
   is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being
   shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the
   expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case
   studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the
   Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures
   and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current
   expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns
   are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging
   throughout the rural spaces of the world. The article argues that
   previously unexplored forms of collective action are expanding the scope
   and content of the ``wind energy debate{''}. In addition to the claims
   of ``landscape{''} and ``wildlife protection{''} addressed by the
   existing literature, this study sheds light on the rural/peripheral
   contexts where opposition emerges through the defense of indigenous
   territories, local livelihoods and communal development projects. The
   study contends that these ``emerging storylines{''} embrace an
   environmental justice perspective when challenging the socially unequal
   and geographically uneven patterns reproduced by the ecological
   modernization paradigm. From this lens, cases of local opposition are
   not interpreted as selfish forces blocking a low-carbon transition, but
   instead, are understood as political instances that enable a wider
   discussion about the ways such transition should take place.},

Title = {Public prioritisation of energy affordability in the UK},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {404-409},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Much research has focused on the so-called `energy trilemma' - i.e.,
   three leading energy policy issues: energy security, affordability, and
   climate change mitigation. Whilst substantial understanding exists of
   why people support climate-friendly energy policies, little is known
   about why they think affordability is important. Particularly, what
   leads members of the public to identify this policy goal as more
   important than other objectives? Here, we examine this question via a
   nationally-representative survey of 2441 UK residents and demonstrate
   that concerns about personal costs explain a small amount of variation
   in the prioritisation of affordability as an energy policy goal; a range
   of other factors also significantly contribute. One such factor is
   beliefs about who is responsible for energy transitions. These findings
   suggest policy actions to address affordability concerns should go
   beyond energy prices, and include additional considerations such as
   distributive justice and equality.},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {89-98},

Abstract = {This essay reviews three recent books on the changing landscape of
   global energy politics in the era of climate change. Key questions that
   the authors investigate include: how will the renewable energy
   transition reshape the global balance of power? How will
   political-economic interdependencies and geopolitical alignments shift?
   Will contemporary petro-states adapt or collapse? And what new patterns
   of peace and conflict may emerge in a decarbonized world order? The
   authors provide different perspectives on the likely speed of the energy
   transition and its geopolitical implications. However, they occlude
   deeper questions about the depth of the transformations needed to
   prevent climate catastrophe-particularly in the nature of capitalism and
   military power-and the potential for more radical perspectives on energy
   futures. In contrast, I will argue that we should advance a critical
   research agenda on the global energy transition that accounts for the
   possibility of more far-reaching transformations in the
   political-economic, military, and ideological bases of world politics
   and highlights diverse movements fighting for their realization. These
   possible transformations include (1) transitions to post-growth
   political economies; (2) a radical shrinkage of emissions-intensive
   military-industrial complexes; and (3) decolonizing ideologies of
   ``progress.{''} If struggles for alternative energy futures beyond the
   hegemony of economic growth and Western-style modernization are at the
   forefront of radical politics today, then these struggles deserve
   greater attention from critical IR scholars.},

Title = {Prevalence of energy poverty in Japan: A comprehensive analysis of
   energy poverty vulnerabilities},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {145},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Energy poverty, defined as the inability to fulfil adequate levels of
   domestic energy services, has been analysed in Japan previously.
   However, neither policy agendas nor official definitions of energy
   poverty have been established yet, resulting in the neglect of
   energy-poor households and other relevant aspects of this issue. This
   study is the first to examine the contextual factors of energy poverty
   in Japan, through the perspective of energy poverty vulnerabilities. The
   study uses a new multidimensional approach, covering the issues of
   affordability and accessibility to different forms of energy, as well as
   the effects of new technologies on the risk of energy poverty. The study
   develops several unexplored issues in previous literature, such as
   access to low-carbon energy as an issue in developed countries. The
   results highlight the role of location, infrastructure and household
   characteristics in influencing the risk of suffering energy poverty in
   Japan. The seasonality of energy poverty in Japan is also analysed,
   revealing higher rates of energy poverty in the northern regions during
   winter and in the southernmost region during summer. Finally, the impact
   of the ongoing energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy
   on energy poverty is discussed.},

Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {A just and sustainable energy transition will require not only new
   fuels, but new energy stories. The dominant, `fossil' myth of energy,
   depoliticizes the forward march of energy intensity over human history.
   Instead, we need energy stories that more fully account for the role of
   political domination in major energy transitions of the past. Fossil
   domination is historically unique in its marriage of racial capitalism
   and imperialism, but it may also reflect broader patterns of fuel
   transition. I draw upon recent research on two momentous energy
   transitions - the rise of grain states and fossil fuel empires - that
   show howpoliticalinnovations in labor extraction and domination were the
   main catalysts for transition, rather than superior fuel technologies or
   a public thirst for more energy. Emphasizing the role of domination
   across energy history disrupts the fossil myth, while also making space
   for more transformative energy stories.},

Title = {Are rapid and inclusive energy and climate transitions oxymorons?
   Towards principles of responsible acceleration},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building from two strands of literature within ``Sociotechnical agendas:
   Reviewing future directions for energy and climate research{''}, this
   perspective piece seeks to open a discussion about how to responsibly
   accelerate transitions. First, we identify a managerial literature on
   how innovation and diffusion can be accelerated, which focuses on
   deliberation with consensus-oriented ambitions. Second, is a set of
   perspectives that highlights unevenness, and therefore seeks to
   radically expand climate and energy democracy by promoting new forms of
   participatory practices. There are few contact points between these
   literatures. We argue that this can be explained by tensions and
   paradoxes that accompany accelerated transitions. These paradoxes cannot
   easily be resolved. We discuss how accelerated social and technological
   change poses challenges to inclusive and participatory transitions.
   Further, we discuss how rapid transitions tends to contribute to
   conflicts between core and peripheral sites. Thus, transitions are not
   only affected by societal conditions, but also contribute to coproducing
   social order, including the many forms of social turmoil currently
   experienced. Such insight places greater responsibilities on transition
   scholars, especially from reflexive disciplines such as STS and
   geography. We conclude by discussing how this responsibility could
   translate into situating climate and energy transition scholarship in
   broader debates about future socio-technical orders, and sketch three
   principles of responsible acceleration: a) Moving towards a broad
   epistemic basis for producing and assessing transition policies and
   strategies, b) Nurturing polycentrism for rapid climate and energy
   transitions, and c) Developing polytemporal strategies for transition.},

Title = {Perceptions of participation and the role of gender for the engagement
   in solar energy communities in Sweden},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background Energy communities are emphasized by the EU as important for
   developing sustainable energy systems that include and engage many
   people. While many renewables are highly compatible with a more
   decentralized energy system, research indicates that participation in
   `desirable' energy activities and energy decision-making is influenced
   by social and economic factors, including gender, economic status and
   home ownership. The overall aim of this article is to contribute to this
   line of inquiry by exploring how and under which conditions energy
   communities allow for broader participation in the energy system. This
   article examines how gender, as a more specific condition, influences
   the extent to which parties can or cannot engage with collective solar
   ownership models by means of a qualitative study of 11 solar energy
   communities and one housing association in Sweden. Results The study
   revealed that despite the relative potential for inclusion that they
   hold, energy communities can raise justice concerns in terms of
   inequities concerning access, capacity, and opportunity to engage in
   decision-making. Conclusions While solely focusing on gender offers a
   limited view of the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in renewable
   energy projects, it is our position that integrating it into the
   analysis will provide insights into possible measures to remedy
   limitations and accelerate the renewable energy transition.},

   energy transitions in urban Australia: A dynamic panel data analysis},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study contributes to an understanding of how the distribution of
   benefits and costs of energy production should occur. In doing so, this
   study draws attention to an uneasy tension between urban planning
   practice focused on urban consolidation and the promotion of solar
   photovoltaic panels in Australia's capital cities. Specifically, this
   study investigates the impact of built environment and feed-in tariffs
   (FiTs) on the installation of solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) in
   Australia's capital cities. It uses a dynamic panel data model to
   analyse a unique dataset of solar PV panel installations at the postcode
   level for Australia's capital cities over the period 2001-2015. The
   results of this study indicate that denser built environments can
   detract from solar PV panel installations in the short-run and in the
   long-run. These effects are distinct from the socioeconomic status of an
   area. Specifically, the results indicate that while increases in the
   density of the built environment detract from solar panel installations,
   these changes in the built environment appear to be more than offset by
   FiTs. The results point to the need to mitigate the risk of energy
   disadvantage entrenchment through urban consolidation policy.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The energy landscape is changing dramatically. Communities are being
   impacted in different ways. Positive impacts include reductions in air
   pollution and new tax revenues from renewables. Negative impacts include
   lost jobs and foregone tax revenues after closure of large fossil fuels
   generation facilities and coal mines. The contours of this transition
   have been further altered by recent events such as the global oil market
   crash and the COVID-19 pandemic. While economic and social issues can be
   addressed through thoughtful policy design, the pace of change, and the
   extent to which communities have a say in what comes next, matter.
   Though the technical issues of transitions are well-researched, the
   socio-economic aspects of the energy transition remain both emergent and
   essential to an equitable transition to a low-carbon energy system. This
   article provides an overview of the history and current status of just

Title = {Resisting renewables: The energy epistemics of social opposition in
   Mexico},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Previous studies have examined the research practices and their
   normative roles in various areas of energy transitions (ETs). However,
   non-economic social research is not usually perceived as influential in
   ETs, thus receiving less attention. I argue that social research plays a
   central role in some components of ETs, and when these areas concern an
   unequal dispute between different interests and visions, then the
   production of knowledge, its outcomes, and its use can have vast energy
   justice implications. This issue is illustrated by the controversy over
   the social effects of renewable energy projects in Mexico. These
   projects have caused significant social opposition and even conflicts in
   indigenous communities, which have generated growing social research.
   Researchers have addressed this issue through different understandings
   of human interactions with projects and methodological choices, shaping
   critical aspects of knowledge-making, such as the voices and agendas of
   the included social groups. In their outcomes, these research practices
   have offered competitive interpretations of the causes of social
   opposition and the alternatives to solutions, which propose different
   material and symbolic roles to communities (e.g., downstream policy
   fixes for addressing social externalities vs. communitarian involvement
   in the decisions, management, and benefits of projects). Through a
   subject of controversy characterized by the lack of domestic regulation
   and experience and limited institutional capacity, social research has
   exceeded the academic domain, providing critical insights into the
   activism, the policy formation, and the practices of governmental and
   private actors. This research extends energy epistemics to social
   research practices, providing critical insights about their effects on
   how societies build energy futures and their interplay with local
   environments.},

   case study on wind energy expansion in Austria},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {863-870},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Wind energy is a key technology in the transition toward a low-carbon
   society, but acceptance is considered to be a constraining factor in
   achieving ambitious wind deployment targets. Based on an Austrian case
   study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and
   non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods,
   such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCafe discussions, with
   stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local
   decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results
   show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single
   factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective
   preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements.
   The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are
   trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are
   unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching
   targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the
   impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for
   fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of
   environmental and economic gains and losses.},

Title = {Desirable or debatable? Putting Africa's decentralised solar energy
   futures in context},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {After decades of terrible ecological impacts, inefficiencies,
   corruption, and spatial injustices associated with dependencies on both
   centralised power generation and distribution in Africa, decentralised
   solar photovoltaic (PV) electrification is presented in the literature
   as an `irresistible' alternative or complement necessary for a just,
   development-oriented and low-carbon energy transition. Affordable
   decentralised solar energy systems, however, currently have restrictive
   usage whereas systems with a larger capacity are accessible to a few
   richer social groups. The massive promotion of decentralised solar
   electrification does not even guarantee energy justice for all. This is
   due to contested notions of entitlements to and use of grid-based and
   off-grid electricity, relative spatial advantages or disadvantages,
   practical constraints linked to the pursuit of low-carbon energy
   solutions particularly in situations where people/governments do not
   feel (morally) obliged to make commitments to climate change mitigation,
   and monopolistic tendencies of electricity distributors/suppliers.
   Furthermore, many electricity users in Africa lack the technical
   know-how and financial resources required for efficient
   self-organisation of decentralised solar PV electrification. Meanwhile,
   paradoxically, global north actors championing low-carbon energy
   technologies in Africa are sustaining their economies via massive use of
   fossil fuels - a behaviour referred to as `energy bullying'.
   Nonetheless, these quandaries should not be taken to imply `throwing
   away the baby with the bathwater'. Evidence presented from four
   idiographic cases suggests even that though context/country-specific
   conditions are decisive of the desirability of decentralised solar
   energy systems, certain general conditions necessary for the wider
   development of the technology in Africa are still discernible.},

Title = {India's new coal geography: Coastal transformations, imported fuel and
   state - business collaboration in the transition to more fossil fuel
   energy},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The advance of renewable energy around the world has kindled hopes that
   coal-based energy is on the way out. Recent data, however, make it clear
   that growing coal consumption in India coupled with its continued use in
   China keeps coal-based energy at 40 percent of the world's heat and
   power generation. To address the consolidation of coal-based power in
   India, this article analyses an energy transition to, rather than away
   from, carbon-intensive energy over the past two decades. We term this
   transition India's new coal geography; the new coal geography comprises
   new ports and thermal power plants run by private-sector actors along
   the coastline and fuelled by imported coal. This geography runs parallel
   to, yet is distinct from, India's `old' coal geography, which was based
   on domestic public-sector coal mining and thermal power generation. We
   understand the development of coastal thermal power as an outcome of
   long-term electrical energy shortages and significant public controversy
   within the old coal geography. By analysing the making of the new coal
   geography at a national level, and scrutinizing its localised
   manifestation and impact through a case study of Goa state, we outline
   the significant infrastructural investment and policy work of a
   dispersed network of public- and private-sector actors that slowly
   enabled this new coal energy avatar. We argue that the enormous effort
   to establish India's new coal geography further entrenches the country's
   reliance on coal. The result is that for India, energy security is a
   choice between domestic and imported coal.},

Title = {Who is energy poor? Revisiting energy (in)security in the case of Nepal},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {49-53},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Current definitions of energy poverty oversimplify the fluid and dynamic
   nature of the lived experiences of the energy impoverished. By drawing
   on empirical observations in the aftermath of Nepal's humanitarian
   crises in 2015, we showcase the vulnerability of vital energy systems
   that threatens human security and negatively impacts on the lives and
   livelihoods of those affected. In search of greater human security, we
   observed a reverse energy transition whereby people abandoned modern
   fuels and returned to biomass-based traditional cooking practices. These
   observations in Nepal suggest that people respond and adapt to energy
   insecurity with strategies that move them in and out of energy
   impoverishment in a much more fluid process than many of the
   contemporary statistics and known indicators imply. After presenting the
   case in Nepal, we invoke several questions that challenge conventional
   ways of conceptualising, identifying and defining energy poverty and
   present a research agenda for strengthening scholarship in this field.

Title = {Climate-friendly but socially rejected energy-transition pathways: The
   integration of techno-economic and socio-technical approaches in the
   Nordic-Baltic region},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A framework to account for social acceptance in the modelling of
   energy-transition pathways is outlined. The geographical focus is on the
   Nordic-Baltic energy region and the technological focus is on onshore
   wind power and power transmission, which are considered key technologies
   in achieving carbon-neutral energy systems in northern Europe. We
   combine qualitative analysis of social acceptance with quantitative
   assessments of scenarios using techno-economic energy-system modelling.
   Key factors in and consequences of social acceptance are identified,
   especially environmental, health, and distributional factors, as well as
   costs for developers and society. The energy system analysis includes
   four scenarios illustrating the system effects and costs of low social
   acceptance. The results indicate that if low social acceptance were to
   restrict investments in onshore wind power, costlier solar photovoltaics
   and offshore wind power would step in. Greater social acceptance cost
   for onshore wind and transmission lines favours local solutions and a
   more balanced renewable energy mix. There are important distributional
   effects: no restrictions on transmission line investments benefit power
   producers while raising consumer prices in the Nordic-Baltic energy
   region, while very low social acceptance of onshore wind power would
   lead to 12\% higher consumer costs. The results imply that
   socio-technical and political factors such as social acceptance may
   significantly affect transition pathway scenarios based on
   techno-economic variables alone. Therefore, the techno-economic,
   socio-technical and political layers of co-evolution of energy systems
   should be considered when analysing long-term energy transitions. It is
   important to link energy-system models with a consideration of the
   dynamics of socio-technical factors.},

Journal = {GEOFORUM},

Volume = {88},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Possibilities for engendering sustainable and just futures are
   foundering in part because key resources are managed by elites through
   `top down' environmental governance and management, and knowledge
   production regimes, largely committed to retaining the status quo, fail
   to pursue new ways of managing resource consumption and distribution. In
   this paper, we argue for an alternative climate justice agenda that is
   enabled through grassroots mobilisation in collaboration with state
   action. To do this we consider the state as a continued terrain of
   possibility for positive social, economic and environmental change,
   noting the imperative of historically attentive state-enabled
   redistribution along persistent axes of difference. In articulating an
   alternative understanding of the state, we emphasise the importance of
   social movements capable of cultivating networked militant
   particularisms that can be channeled through and beyond state governance
   processes. In order to ground these ideas, we provide two brief case
   studies, tracking food sovereignty and energy re municipalization
   initiatives.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In addition to the climate and energy aspects, energy transition also
   includes the political dimension: influencing changes in energy
   production and distribution, and technological changes may infringe the
   interests of state and corporate institutions dominant in the energy
   sector. At the same time, it can be an impulse to awaken social
   aspirations for empowerment in the energy sphere. Due to these tensions,
   the ruling energy and political system uses various mechanisms of social
   control, which are called energy/power in this article, whose task is to
   defend the position of the power elite in the energy system. The article
   outlines the concept of energy/power as a set of political control
   systems, which uses the energy policy of the state and corporations to
   establish the order of knowledge, procedures and economic relations, on
   both an individual and social level, supporting the mechanisms of the
   ruling system of power and preserving the existing social structures.
   However, energy/power also defines the areas of possible emancipation in
   the sphere of energy policy and a map of the main tensions between the
   state and the market on the one hand, and the civil energy sphere, on
   the other, which will accompany energy transition.},

Title = {A framework for assessing fossil fuel `retrofit' hydrogen exports:
   Security-justice implications of Australia's coal-generated hydrogen
   exports to Japan},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {223},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {This article addresses transnational `retrofit' brown coal hydrogen
   generation energy systems. Retrofit energy supply-chains, from
   generation to end product, encompass fossil fuel energy generation with
   retrofitted carbon capture and storage (CCS), for clean energy
   {[}hydrogen] output. Three research questions are posited: can an energy
   security framework be identified for analysis of fossil fuel retrofit
   hydrogen exports; what findings arise from applying the framework to a
   case study of Australian exports of coal-generated hydrogen to Japan;
   and are such international energy systems compromised by suboptimal
   carbon-emitting supply chains, with potential implications for global
   energy justice? A systematic literature review identified a modified
   framework, further developed in this article to catalyse global energy
   security-justice analysis; contributing a useful energy security-justice
   tool. Applying the framework, findings illustrate key opportunities in
   Australia/Japan's energy diversification, supply security, and bilateral
   trade-strategic security relationships. Key risks include emissions and
   economic costs, risks in the production process, shipping complexities,
   and doubts concerning CCS. Interests of conservative politics and
   pro-coal/CCS influencers dominate how security is framed, deprioritising
   energy justice concerns and privileging coal interests and mining jobs
   over potentially more resilient renewable energy pathways and jobs. The
   research has implications for future research, policy development and
   energy system planning.

Title = {Building communities in times of crisis-Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
   on the work of transition intermediaries in the energy sector},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affects people worldwide. The policies in
   response to the virus range from closure of national borders to curfews
   for entire metropolises, like Paris. While we can expect severe impacts
   on the world economy, the consequences of the pandemic for local
   sustainability transitions are entirely unclear. In this exploratory
   study, we investigate how the current situation affects the work of
   transition intermediaries in the energy sector. More concretely, we aim
   to analyse the impact of COVID-19 policies on community energy projects
   and the subsequent change of work practices of intermediaries in this
   situation. Our data consists of qualitative data we collected between
   January and October 2020. Our results show that transition
   intermediaries are affected in different ways. Most notably, the work on
   networking suffers during these times of crisis. We found that
   intermediaries are particularly challenged in their ability to build
   trust. This particularly affects new and complex community energy
   projects and intermediation activities needed for systemic change. We
   found that established projects with a strong trust base are least
   affected by these limitations. Intermediaries dependent on private
   funding face much bigger problems than publically funded organisations.
   Our results offer some novel and relevant insights in the role and work
   of transition intermediaries and the development of community energy
   projects in times of crisis. These findings can help governments,
   intermediary organizations and citizen groups to design future
   transition processes in ways that are more resilient to external shocks.},

Title = {Public values for energy system change},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {59-69},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the importance of framing the question of
   public acceptance of sustainable energy transitions in terms of values
   and a `whole-system' lens. This assertion is based on findings arising
   from a major research project examining public values, attitudes and
   acceptability with regards to whole energy system change using a
   mixed-method (six deliberative workshops, n=68, and a nationally
   representative survey, n = 2441), interdisciplinary approach. Through
   the research we identify a set of social values associated with
   desirable energy futures in the UK, where the values represent
   identifiable cultural resources people draw on to guide their preference
   formation about particular aspects of energy system change. As such, we
   characterise public perspectives as being underpinned by six value
   clusters relating to efficiency and wastefulness, environment and
   nature, security and stability, social justice and fairness, autonomy
   and power, and processes and change. We argue that this `value system'
   provides a basis for understanding core reasons for public acceptance or
   rejection of different energy system aspects and processes. We conclude
   that a focus on values that underpin more specific preferences for
   energy system change brings insights that could provide a basis for
   improved dialogue, more robust decision-making, and for anticipating
   likely points of conflict in energy transitions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {Greening the road: China's low-carbon energy transition and
   international trade regulation},
Journal = {LEIDEN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-378},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article offers one of the first comprehensive analyses of China's
   emerging practice in subsidizing the low carbon energy (LCE) transition
   by using the new energy vehicles (NEVs) industry as a case study. It
   puts forward a fresh framework for this analysis by dividing the NEV
   value chain into three segments: upstream, midstream, and downstream.
   Based on this framework, it expounds a strategic shift of China's
   subsidization strategy across the NEV value chain, that is, from
   disproportionately subsidizing the midstream segment that produces NEVs
   and parts to increasingly subsidizing the upstream and downstream
   segments to promote research and development (R\&D) and expansion of NEV
   infrastructure and consumption throughout the economy. It argues that
   this shift mainly comes out of the evolution of China's industrial
   policies and economic priorities, which will continue to play a decisive
   role in the future restructuring and transformation of the NEVs sector.
   This shift may also reflect China's intention to reduce potential trade
   conflicts and maximize WTO-compliance but only to the extent that doing
   so would not unduly constrain its capacity to pursue its economic goals
   and industrial policies. In addition, while the WTO rules and
   jurisprudence may accommodate some of these subsidies (e.g., NEV
   infrastructure subsidies), the relevant rules will need to be further
   developed to provide more policy space for other types of subsidies used
   worldwide (e.g., R\&D subsidies). Until then, it remains debatable as to
   whether the WTO provides sufficient room for countries to facilitate a
   green recovery in the post-pandemic era.},

Title = {Towards a just energy transition: a critical analysis of the existing
   policies and regulations in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW \& BUSINESS},
Abstract = {The concept of just transition is included in the texts that establish
   the energy policy of the European Union (EU), in particular in the texts
   relating to the European Green Deal. The idea refers to the need to
   compensate the inhabitants of those regions where coal-fired power
   plants or coalmines are closed, to try to maintain employment and
   activity. There is a proposal for a regulation that establishes a Just
   Transition Fund, as the main element of the Just Transition Mechanism.
   The fund is the focus in coal areas. This norm is inserted in the set of
   norms for the reconstruction of Europe (NextGenerationEU). The same idea
   of just transition is found in the laws that various European countries
   have passed (or are proposing to pass), such as the UK, Germany, Spain
   and Poland. It is assumed that energy justice requires that in those
   areas where new forms of electricity production are being implemented,
   using renewable sources of energy, which displace coal, workers must be
   compensated. This perspective is the one that has become general, due to
   the influence of the energy policy of the EU and its law. This article
   does also show that limiting the just transition to coal problems is
   inadequate, since the transition generates other problems related to
   energy justice (such as the implementation of renewable facilities in
   rural areas, environmental impacts, energy poverty, etc). In other
   words, the article highlights that there are several potential winners
   and losers in the energy transition, other than coal regions and
   workers. To illustrate that idea we pick three remarkable examples: (i)
   the mining of lithium, since it is a key for electric mobility, but can
   create environmental and/or social problems; (ii) damages to rural areas
   from wind or sun installations (iii) and the increase of energy poverty.},

Title = {An incandescent truth: Disparities in energy-efficient lighting
   availability and prices in an urban US county},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {95-103},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {In the U.S. lighting represents about 9\% of the average household's
   primary energy consumption and 20\% of the average household's energy
   bill. Lighting in U.S. homes is in a state of transition with steady
   growth in the adoption of more energy-efficient lighting technology,
   such as, compact florescent lamps (CFL) and light-emitting diodes
   (LEDs). However, the adoption of energy-efficient lighting is not
   equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups, with poorer
   households less likely to adopt than higher-income households. This case
   study in Wayne County, Michigan explores the lack of parity in
   energy-efficient lighting adoption from an energy justice perspective by
   evaluating distributional disparities in light bulb availability and
   price in 130 stores across four poverty strata and five store types for
   a more holistic understanding of potential barriers for poorer
   households. We found that (1) energy-efficient bulbs were less available
   in high-poverty areas and smaller stores; (2) energy-efficient bulbs
   were more expensive in high-poverty areas and smaller stores; (3)
   upgrade costs from incandescent and halogen lamps (IHLs) to CFLs or LEDs
   were higher in high poverty areas; and (4) both poverty and store type
   were significant predictors of LED availability, while store type was
   the most significant predictor of LED price variability. We suggest
   several ways that the development and implementation of energy
   efficiency policies and programs may consider these disparities that
   affect access and affordability, in order to achieve a more just
   energy-efficient transition.},

Abstract = {Climate change mitigation and adaptation require a transition of the
   energy system from one that relies on fossil fuels and is vulnerable to
   major climate events to one that is dependent on renewable energy
   resources and able to withstand climate extremes. Resilience has emerged
   as a conceptual frame to drive both climate and energy policy in this
   transitional moment. For example, in the wake of major storms such as
   Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, policymakers have frequently called for
   greater resilience of the energy system and resilience of vulnerable
   communities impacted by the storms.
   This Article focuses on resilience at the system level. It argues that,
   in many cases, resilience of the energy system may actually reify
   structural inequality and exacerbate vulnerability. A hardening of
   existing energy infrastructure may also operate to harden existing
   social, economic, and environmental injustices that disproportionately
   burden the poor and people of color. Such situations call for new
   framings beyond resilience and transition toward liberation and
   transformation. This Article argues that, to facilitate the liberation
   of low-income communities and communities of color from the
   disproportionate impacts they face under the current energy system-and
   to foster a just transformation of the energy system-activists,
   policy-makers, and scholars engaged in the work of climate and energy
   justice must adopt a framework of anti-resilience: An anti-racist and
   anti-oppression policy approach focused on the greater social and
   economic inclusion of people of color and low-income communities in the
   renewable energy transition.},

   pro-governmental media on energy transition and climate change},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Is populist politics a threat to ambitious climate action and
   decarbonisation of energy systems? With the coinciding challenges of an
   alleged global `populist wave,' and the growing visibility of a
   planetary climate crisis, this issue has gained relevance. While
   theoretical literature on the links between populism and climate action
   is growing, there is still little empirical evidence regarding the ways
   in which the thin ideology of populism can interact with climate policy
   in practice (particularly in the context of Eastern Europe). We look
   into this black box, by analyzing the Polish right-wing populist media
   discourses on energy and climate. Poland is widely perceived as a
   laggard in European climate policy and energy transition, seeking to
   safeguard domestic coal as a major energy source and opposing ambitious
   decarbonisation goals. At the same time, since 2015 it has seen a
   right-wing populist government in power, making it a very interesting
   case for an analysis of the interaction of populist politics and climate
   action. Using four key elements of populist political rhetoric as a
   framework (a populist episteme, Manichean good and evil connotations and
   internal enemies) we organize the arguments distilled from a wide
   reading of pro-governmental right-wing Polish media, to illustrate the
   content of populist climate and energy discourse, seeing some of the
   tropes found in our case as generalizable to other national contexts.},

Abstract = {There is an emerging scholarship that criticises the conceptualisation
   of urban informality from a deficit view and emphasises that informality
   constitutes a way of life, a practice in its own right. We argue that
   energy is part of the informal way of life and that energy transitions
   need to take into account the specificities of urban informality when
   used for policy. Acknowledging energy practices is necessary to improve
   the justice of energy transitions, including the urban poor in energy
   transitions without denying the legitimacy of slum dwellers' ways of
   life. In this paper, we analyse energy governance in informal urban
   settlements as implemented by national governments, municipalities and
   non-governmental organisations, with case studies from Sub-Saharan
   Africa. We develop a policy analysis framework that assesses (1) the
   practices of problem definition; (2) the creation of policy options and
   strategy; (3) the mix of capacities mobilised; and (4) the type of
   instruments used. The framework is applied to three case studies of
   energy policies in informal settlements in Kenya, South Africa and
   Uganda. Results show a strong preference for regulation and
   technological fixes and do not create capacity to acknowledge and
   integrate the specific challenges of urban informality and informal ways
   of life in energy policy, hence falling short of addressing social
   justice in energy transitions.},

Title = {The Emerging Potential of Microgrids in the Transition to 100\%
   Renewable Energy Systems},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {International, national, and subnational laws and policies call for
   rapidly decarbonizing energy systems around the globe. This effort
   relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that
   is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end
   uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other
   threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in
   comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems
   that are often the result of-or the cause of-procedural, distributive,
   and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of
   technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of
   how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are
   flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative
   examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and
   elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid
   characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of
   microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100\%
   renewable electricity standards (Hawai'i and Puerto Rico), and which are
   actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable
   renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although
   microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100\%
   renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy
   structures require substantial further development to operationalize
   that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions
   arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the
   benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from
   technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating
   characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research
   will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid
   policies. In particular, there is a need to develop
   socio-techno-economic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a
   broad range of potential benefits and costs.},

Title = {Contributing to sustainable and just energy systems? The mainstreaming
   of renewable energy prosumerism within and across institutional logics},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Renewable energy (RE) prosumerism comes with promises and expectations
   of contributing to sustainable and just energy systems. In its current
   process of becoming mainstream, numerous challenges and doubts have
   arisen whether it will live up to these. Building on insights from
   sustainability transitions research and institutional theory, this
   article unpacks the mainstreaming by considering the range of
   institutional arrangements and logics through which these contributions
   might be secured. Taking a Multi-actor Perspective, it analyses the
   differences, combinations, and tensions between institutional logics,
   associated actor roles and power relations. Firstly, it unpacks how
   mainstreaming occurs through mechanisms of bureaucratisation and
   standardisation (state logic), marketisation and commodification (market
   logic), as well as socialisation and communalisation (community logic).
   Secondly, it highlights the concomitant hybridisation of institutional
   logics and actor roles. Such hybrid institutional arrangements try to
   reconcile not only the more known trade-offs and tensions between
   for-profit/non-profit logics (regarding the distribution of benefits for
   energy activities and resources), but also between formal/informal
   logics (gaining recognition) and public/private logics (delineating
   access). This institutional concreteness moves the scholarly discussion
   and policy debate beyond idealistic discussions of ethical principles
   and abstract discussions about power: Simplistic framings of
   `prosumerism vs incumbents' are dropped in favour of a critical
   discussion of hybrid institutional arrangements and their capacity to
   safeguard particular transformative ideals and normative commitments.},

Abstract = {Within climate-energy-transport scholarship and professions there is a
   growing consensus that electric vehicles (EVs), which include personal
   cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, and pickup trucks, are
   essential for decarbonizing mobility. This article urges caution and
   pause before an EV lock-in and calls on geographers and other scholars,
   professionals, and sustainability advocates to consider the multiscale
   environmental and social problems associated with EVs. The article
   begins by reviewing the mainstream assumptions about mass EV uptake,
   with particular emphasis on projections forecasting more, not fewer,
   cars in the future. Using a mobility justice framework, I ask who is
   making these assumptions and why and discuss the influence of liberal
   economic theory on future projections of EVs. I next consider
   assumptions about the environmental efficacy and decarbonization
   potential of mass EV uptake and review how EV production and consumption
   might escalate rather than reduce global resource and energy demand. I
   also scale down to cities and describe how EVs will lay claim to many of
   the same spaces designated for green mobility, such as cycle tracks, bus
   lanes, and compact, walkable spaces. The conclusion proposes research
   questions to consider with regard to EVs, future transportation, future
   geographies, and future carbon emissions.},

Title = {Transboundary hydropower in contested contexts: Energy security,
   capabilities, and justice in comparative perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {More than 70\% of the dams under construction or planned in major river
   basins are transboundary. In this paper, based on original data and
   field research in three continents, we explore the impacts of
   transboundary dams in the major hydropower states of Laos, Paraguay, and
   Bhutan. We do so by looking at dimensions pertaining to energy security
   and technological capabilities and reflecting on the challenges faced by
   these countries under the lens of energy justice. The paper integrates
   elements from the energy security and justice frameworks with the
   concept of technological capabilities to study the distribution of
   energy benefits between partner countries and to shed light on until now

Title = {European Green Deal necropolitics: Exploring `green' energy transition,
   degrowth \& infrastructural colonization},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {97},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article critically examines the GND (Green New Deal) platform by
   exploring the reality of energy development under the European Green
   Deal (EGD). Taking a special interest in degrowth positions on energy
   development, the article argues that the European Green Deal is an
   exercise in necropolitics; intensifying market relationships,
   extraction, and infrastructural colonization. The article proceeds by
   reviewing and discussing recent environmental justice and degrowth
   positions on energy infrastructural development. The methodology
   outlines desk-based research on resource extraction as well as on the
   European energy markets. This accompanies multi-sited ethnographic
   fieldwork, charting environmental conflicts along a 400kv high-tension
   power line. This line goes across France, Catalonia and Southern Spain,
   stretching into Morocco and occupied Western Sahara. Unconventional
   research techniques, such as hitchhiking, enabled mobility and expanding
   the informal interview pool. Outlining the objectives of the EGD, the
   next section examines three aspects of its necropolitics. First,
   necropolitical economy reveals the reality of energy market
   liberalization under the EGD. Second, necropolitical extraction examines
   the expansion of mining and mineral processing, which are necessary for
   the EGD and `mainstream' GNDs. Third, necropolitical operation reveal
   the reality of `a rapid rollout of renewable energy deployment' by
   examining infrastructure conflicts along a 400kv power line between
   France and Spain. The process of infrastructural colonization is
   detailed, which also introduces different land defender perspectives on
   degrowth. Affirming the argument that the EGD is an exercise in
   necropolitics, the conclusion discusses important ways to expand
   degrowth, energy ecologies and real energy transition.},

Title = {Pipelining Appalachia: A perspective on the everyday lived experiences
   of rural communities at the frontline of energy distribution networks
   development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The transport of natural gas through transmission and distribution
   networks spans 2.4 million miles of underground and above ground
   pipelines in the USA. This Perspective uses a critical energy justice
   framework to analyze Appalachian's everyday lived experiences at the
   frontline of energy distribution network development. The practice of
   installing pipelines, as well as the sheer magnitude of the pipeline
   system, has transformed small rural communities into industrial sites.
   This Perspective also adds to the emerging concept of energy justice by
   bringing to the forefront Appalachian residents' voices in relation to
   burgeoning pipeline constructions, which are often missing from the
   debate on energy independence. Energy justice is based on the principle
   that people should not only have safe and affordable energy, but they
   should be protected from disproportionate negative impacts associated
   with generating and transmitting energy as well. Our findings are that
   those who reside near pipelines express fear of explosions, leaks, and
   negative health outcomes and are disproportionately impacted. In
   addition, they are concerned about regulation, state responsibility, and
   threats of eminent domain. We highlight how these communities are
   socially affected, and how residents' daily lives are altered in
   inequitable ways by the construction of energy distribution networks.},

Title = {Solar `power': Socio-political dynamics of infrastructural development

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {270-278},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The growth and development of solar energy, which is so important in the
   current global context, is determined by political economic factors, and
   in turn, has varied implications for energy justice. India's western
   region presents a complex context within which to examine why these
   trajectories unfold in particular ways and to what end. This article
   first situates India's renewable energy policy within the dynamics of
   its federal politics. It then focusses on the trajectory of renewable
   energy development in two Western Indian states, Rajasthan and Gujarat,
   highlighting how regional particularities and path dependence have
   shaped the emergence of solar energy, often in ways that run counter to
   both expected and hoped for results. The idea of energy justice is
   subsequently introduced as a way to evaluate whether solar energy
   infrastructural growth in its present form is best serving the
   multi-pronged needs of climate justice, economic development, and social
   equity. By combining a political economy of renewable energy that
   accounts for the political and institutional factors conditioning the
   growth of solar capacity with the normative arguments embedded in the
   energy justice literature, this study contributes to a growing
   understanding of the intersection of solar power and development.},

   industry: Dilemmas and agency at the frontline of South Africa's energy
   transition},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Renewable energy companies increasingly employ community engagement
   professionals tasked with facilitating dialogue and collaborative
   activities with communities in project areas. Situated at the interface
   between corporate renewable energy production and community needs and
   grievances, these practitioners occupy a potentially significant
   position in the everyday implementation of socially just energy
   transitions. In this article we contribute to the understanding of
   corporate community engagement professionals in the renewable energy
   sector, with a focus on their challenges and agency inside the companies
   that employ them. Through an in-depth qualitative study of community
   engagement professionals in the South African wind- and solar industries
   we identify three key dilemmas faced by the involved practitioners,
   namely (i) how to pursue personal ideals in a corporate context, (ii)
   how to make a difference from a marginalised position inside the
   company, and (iii) how to deliver results without practice frameworks.
   We further find that they actively seek to address these dilemmas
   through a range of measures, such as embedding personal ideals in their
   everyday work, mobilising their position at the interface between
   company and community, and creatively piecing together their own
   approaches to community engagement. Our findings thereby indicate that
   corporate community engagement professionals should be understood and
   analysed as actors in their own right, rather than mere extensions of
   the company leadership.},

Abstract = {Vietnam has experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades,
   as well as growing environmental pressures. The country is therefore
   pursuing strategies for green transformations, which are the processes
   of restructuring to bring economies and societies within the planetary
   boundaries. This article addresses the opportunities, barriers, and
   trade-offs for green transformations in Vietnam's energy sector and
   examines them from an energy justice perspective. The article draws on
   in-depths expert interviews with representatives from government
   agencies, private firms, academic institutions, and multilateral
   institutions in Vietnam. The article finds that Vietnam is undergoing
   efforts to move away from business as usual by promoting renewable
   energy and energy efficiency, as well as aligning energy and climate
   plans with national development priorities such as energy security and
   economic growth. Yet there is a need for more coordinated, integrated
   approaches and policies that span across the 3 areas that address green
   transformations in Vietnam: green growth, sustainable development, and
   climate change. Finally, although key actors seem to be aware and may be
   critical of major trade-offs such as land grabs for energy projects, the
   impacts on affected people need to be better understood and mitigated.},

Title = {Realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13 in
   sub-Saharan Africa by 2030: synergizing energy and climate justice
   perspectives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW \& BUSINESS},
Abstract = {This article discusses how energy policy measures for realizing the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13 in
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) could be framed towards achieving energy
   justice by 2030. Both goals highlight interdependent and conflicting
   interactions that policymakers should be aware of whilst working to
   realize them. This position is quite challenging for developing
   countries that seek to simultaneously resolve the rising inequality of
   access to modern and affordable energy systems as stipulated in the SDG
   7, whilst at the same time working to meet their international
   obligations towards the attainment of SDG 13. This article seeks to
   resolve this conflict by proposing some viable measures for a synergy
   between SDGs 7 and 13. It further examines the paradoxical situation
   faced by countries in the SSA region and argues for a contextualization
   of the two goals within the energy justice framework. The proposed
   approach entails a systematic transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon
   through socio-economic policies that take into account social injustices
   and further incorporate sustainable actions such as developing renewable
   energy technologies, diversification of energy options, energy
   efficiency, and regional alignments and/or cooperation. Overall, the
   measures outlined in this article aim to help the SSA region achieve
   energy justice towards 2030.},

Abstract = {Energy transition is attracting increasing attention in academic,
   activist and policy debate. Although there is a recognition of the
   urgency of achieving a more sustainable model, and a small body of
   scholars contend the need for a systemic transition, very little
   research has specifically been conducted on the changes and proposals
   promoted by grassroots innovations. This paper explores why energy
   grassroots initiatives are key spaces of interest in the process of
   energy transition, and proposes an exploratory characterisation of a
   ``Transformative Energy Transition.{''} To this end, a qualitative
   analysis is carried out and a framework developed that connects ideas
   from socio-technical transitions theory, grassroots innovation
   literature and the human development approach. The results suggest five
   broad arguments to justify why the initiatives studied are relevant, and
   the paper concludes that ``Transformative Energy Transition{''} must be
   aligned with values of equity, sustainability, participation and

Title = {Platforms in Power: Householder Perspectives on the Social,
   Environmental and Economic Challenges of Energy Platforms},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {New business models and digital infrastructures, in the form of `energy
   platforms', are emerging as part of a transition towards decarbonised,
   decentralised, and digitised energy systems. These energy platforms
   offer new ways for householders to trade or exchange energy with other
   households or with energy system actors, but also bring along
   challenges. This paper examines how householders engage with potential
   environmental, social, and economic opportunities and risks of energy
   platforms. We convened two serious-game style workshops in which Dutch
   frontrunner householders assumed the role of platform members and were
   challenged to deliberate about different scenarios and issues. The
   workshop results, while explorative in nature, are indicative of a
   willingness to pursue energy system integration rather than autarky or
   grid defection. The idea of energy platforms as vehicles for energy
   justice appealed less to the householders, although the participants
   were moderately interested in sharing surplus renewable energy. Finally,
   environmental motivations were of key importance in householders'
   evaluation of different platform types. This shows that in the role of
   energy platform members, householders can engage with both the community
   and the grid in new and different ways, leading to a diversity of
   possible outcomes for householder engagement.},

Title = {Managing a transition to green energy sources: The perspectives of
   energy practitioners in the Southern African Development Community
   region.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Southern African Development Community (SADC) region has low energy
   security, exacerbated by electricity power cuts and load-shedding in
   almost all its member states. Green energy has the potential to
   contribute to the shortfall in the supply of energy required on the grid
   network during daily (morning and evening) and seasonal (winter) peak
   periods. The Statistica 12 program was used to analyse and compare
   responses between identified groups in the SADC region's Energy sector.
   Multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance were used to
   examine associations between variables within the identified categories
   of respondents, and conclusions were made about six hypotheses. The
   categories of respondents sampled included: people associated with
   fossil fuel and renewable energy; people with experience of 1-6 years
   and more than 6 years; researchers and industry practitioners;
   practitioners based in South Africa and in other SADC countries; and a
   category based on practitioners' positions (junior managers, middle
   managers, and senior managers) in their respective organisations. The
   study found that energy practitioners generally support a transition to
   green energy sources and there is consensus that the uptake of green
   energy will be slow initially, driven by low costs of fossilbased
   sources, but the uptake will eventually grow exponentially to a point of
   driving industries in future. The study recommends that SADC countries
   prioritise mapping of green energy resources to facilitate the selection
   of suitable green energy options in order to meet local energy needs and
   environmental protection. Research and development of suitable green
   energy storage technologies to overcome intermittency of some green
   energy sources must be expedited in the region.},

Title = {Beyond Forecasting: Using a Modified Delphi Method to Build Upon
   Participatory Action Research in Developing Principles for a Just and
   Inclusive Energy Transition},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Energy transition debates have been characterized by a strong emphasis
   on the technical implications of shifting away from fossil fuels to
   renewable energy sources, with little consideration of social contexts.
   This is now changing, with a growing emphasis on reconfiguring the
   social aspects of energy, particularly in terms of introducing more
   democratic processes into behavior change and energy practice
   engagements. This article situates itself within these debates and
   demonstrates the transformative potential of combining participatory
   action research (PAR) approaches with a modified Delphi method for
   understanding energy transition issues, particularly beyond forecasting
   instruments. There remains a dearth in literature combining the Delphi
   method with PAR; its application in the field of energy transitions is
   very innovative. PAR draws from grassroots and local-based knowledge,
   Delphi panels typically focus on the insights from a panel of
   professional experts. In combining these two approaches, to develop
   principles for an inclusive and just energy transition, a reflexive form
   of dialogue emerges that gives voice to what are often considered
   dissonant or mismatched perspectives. Furthermore, the experimental use
   of a modified Delphi panel, combined with PAR, offers a strategy to
   promote knowledge sharing between different groups and to counter
   potential communication barriers among different actors in society. This
   article shows how a modified Delphi panel approach is considerably
   enhanced by combining elements of PAR, raising the potential of Delphi
   panels beyond forecasting instruments, which often seek to determine the
   way the future ``will be,{''} toward an envisioning tool that
   collaboratively seeks to explore the way a low-carbon system ``could
   be,{''} or perhaps ``should be.{''} The development of energy transition
   principles, endorsed through the modified Delphi panel, offers a
   concrete way to enact practices of energy justice within a more
   democratized energy system.},

Title = {Confronting Energy Poverty in Europe: A Research and Policy Agenda},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper scrutinizes existing policy efforts to address energy poverty
   at the governance scale of the European Union (EU) and its constituent
   Member States. Our main starting point is the recent expansion of energy
   poverty policies at the EU level, fuelled by the regulatory provisions
   of the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, as well as the
   establishment of an EU Energy Poverty Observatory. Aided by a systematic
   and customized methodology, we survey the extensive scientific body of
   work that has recently been published on the topic, as well as the
   multiple strategies and measures to address energy poverty that have
   been formulated across the EU. This includes the principal mitigation
   approaches adopted by key European and national institutions. We develop
   a framework to judge the distributional and procedural justice
   provisions within the recently adopted National Energy and Climate
   Plans, as an indicator of the power, ability and resolve of relevant
   institutions to combat the causes and consequences of energy injustice.
   We also provide a research and policy agenda for future action,
   highlighting a series of scientific and decision-making challenges in
   the European and global context.},

Title = {Race and the politics of energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Once again, the issue of race is dominating world events. Acts of police
   violence and the removal of statues of slave traders have drawn
   attention to issues of structural inequality, institutional racism and
   historical exploitation, particularly that which is associated with
   colonialism. I want to argue in this perspective article that the study
   of energy transitions needs to take issues of race more seriously than
   it has generally done so to date, and I want to point to some ways in
   which it can do so, building on emerging work and incorporating insights
   from other areas of scholarship and activism. I suggest four areas of
   intersection between race and the study of energy transitions as
   possible entry points for deepening engagement with these issues: the
   historically racialised production of energy systems; the racialised
   governance of energy systems; the socially uneven (including racialised)
   impacts of energy transitions pathways and the racialised politics of
   contestation and resistance.},

Title = {Accountability and sustainability transitions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {185},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {What constitutes a sustainability transition? We identify sustainability
   transitions as premised on shifts in accountability relations ?
   assessments of conformance with institutional controls coupled with
   application of sanctions, incentives, and subsidies ? which structure
   the selection pressures that shape future demographics, technical
   practices, and social and material trajectories of an economic sector or
   domain. Contestation and adaptation of accountability mechanisms lend
   themselves to empirical observation. Beyond evaluating institutional
   changes that might support a sustainability transition, our analytic
   framework positions us to identify incoherent, hollow and regressive
   modes of accountability that constrain sustainability transitions. To
   operationalize our conceptual scheme, we analyze a purported case of
   sustainability transitions, solar energy in Portugal during the period
   2017?2020. This empirical analysis juxtaposes the promise of movement to
   a more equitable, low-carbon energy future with institutional and
   material inertia. We draw on expert interviews, field observation and
   secondary research to apply accountability analysis to this energy
   transition case. We find evidence of shifts in relations of
   accountability that bode well for accelerated growth of solar uptake in
   Portugal. More broadly, this pilot application of an analytic framework
   for studying relations of accountability shows significant promise for
   advancing environmental governance research.},

Title = {What is the state of the art in energy and transport poverty metrics? A
   critical and comprehensive review},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This review investigates the state of the art in metrics used in energy
   (or fuel) and transport poverty with a view to assessing how these
   overlapping concepts may be unified in their measurement. Our review
   contributes to ongoing debates over decarbonisation, a politically
   sensitive and crucial aspect of the energy transition, and one that
   could exacerbate patterns of inequality or vulnerability. Up to 125
   million people across the European Union experience the effects of
   energy poverty in their daily lives. A more comprehensive understanding
   of the breadth and depth of these conditions is therefore paramount.
   This review assessed 1,134 articles and critically analysed a deeper
   sample of 93. In terms of the use of metrics, we find that multiple
   indicators are better than any single metric or composite. We find work
   remains to be conducted in the transport poverty sphere before energy
   poverty metrics can be fully unified with those of transport poverty,
   namely the stipulation of travel standards. Without such standards, our
   ability to unify the metrics of both fields and potentially alleviate
   both conditions simultaneously is limited. The difficulties in defining
   necessary travel necessitate the further use of vulnerability lenses and
   holistic assessments focused on energy and transport services.},

Title = {Are the pens working for justice? News media coverage of renewable
   energy involving Indigenous Peoples in Canada},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Some are suggesting that renewable energy by, for, and in Indigenous
   communities can provide a vehicle for both Indigenous-settler
   reconciliation, and climate change mitigation in Canada. Yet very little
   empirical research aimed at understanding this kind of energy transition
   has been published to date. In this paper, we present findings from an
   analysis of five large, mainstream (CBC, Globe and Mail, National Post,
   Vancouver Sun, Toronto Star) and Indigenous (APTN) Canadian media
   outlets from 2008 to 2017 (n = 153). Using Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing)
   and energy justice frameworks, we are interested in the ways Indigenous
   Peoples are being written about and perceived among the Canadian public.
   We use content analysis to understand more about the types of issues
   being brought forth into the public eye, and critical discourse analysis
   to assess each outlet's telling and framing of these stories. Findings
   indicate that stories of Indigenous opposition to large scale hydro
   development dominate our sample - articles of protest, lawsuits, and
   threats to nation-to-nation-building that are more commonly seen in
   extractive industries. Stories covering other technologies (e.g. solar,
   wind) showcase excitement, positive socio-economic benefit, and
   opportunities for reconciliation. Second, and against the backdrop of
   historical misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples, we find what some
   may deem exemplars of fair coverage of Indigenous Peoples and renewable
   energy. Despite the absence of overt racist phrases - as seen in the
   recent past - authors rarely attend to the colonial history that has
   created structural issues prevalent in communities today. In the face of
   long-standing (energy) injustices, we question how far the coverage goes
   towards raising alternative and Indigenous perspectives. We close the
   paper with what we see as potential for future research trajectories to
   critically consider the role of the news media in addressing
   nation-to-nation relationships in Canada and other colonized
   territories.},

Title = {Decarbonisation of the power sector to engender a `Just transition' in
   Japan: Quantifying local employment impacts},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {``Just Transition{''} is an important, brand new concept to implement
   policies towards decarbonisation of the power sector in Japan. However,
   a knowledge gap still remains between this concept and policy discussion
   at a practical level. Therefore, using the existing scenarios of
   decarbonisation of the power sector and employment factors for the power
   sector based on extended input-output tables, this study analysed ``Just
   Transition{''} issues, looking at the concept from three aspects:
   distributional justice to identify key impacts by location and economic
   sector; recognition justice to assess key inequalities; and procedural
   justice which deal with fair process and possible measures to enhance
   acceptability of climate policies. The results of this study show that
   achieving decarbonisation of the power sector provides a net increase in
   domestic employment and supplies stable jobs in rural areas, thereby
   contributing to the revitalisation of the local economy. Furthermore, it
   improves inequalities in the working age population. Support from either
   national or local government is required to ensure a workforce is in
   place to enable a rapid increase in renewable energy. To achieve
   decarbonisation of the power sector with high political acceptability,
   it is essential to make early decision on the retirement of conventional
   power plants and to implement policy support for the surplus workers
   from conventional power plants.},

Title = {COVID-19 energy sector responses in Africa: A review of preliminary
   government interventions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented shocks across all
   facets of society, from strained healthcare systems to the closure of
   schools and economies. The energy sector is of no exception, with
   several concerns being raised about the ramifications that will arise
   for the clean energy transition. The goal of our study is to review how
   governments in Africa have responded to this challenge in the energy
   sector. We used an internet search to gather information from government
   policy statements/briefs, and websites of international organizations
   such as the IMF, WHO, KPMG, and the World Bank. Our review revealed that
   the majority of preliminary responses were short-term and include the
   provision of free electricity, waiver/suspension of bill payments, and
   VAT exemptions on electricity bills. These measures were more pronounced
   in sub-Sahara Africa while oil-rich countries of the North mostly have
   broad economic measures that target their oil and gas sectors. Economic
   stimulus packages prepared by most countries do not explicitly mention
   energy sector companies/institutions, especially the Renewable Energies
   (RE) sector. Only three countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Burkina Faso) had
   specific interventions for renewables. Overall, interventions were
   mostly fiscal/financial and short-term, with medium to long term
   measures often broad without being specific to the energy sector. As
   governments take measures to bolster their economies, they must pay
   particular attention to the challenges posed by the pandemic in the
   energy sector and capitalize on the opportunities that it presents to
   drive the clean energy transition.},

Title = {Understanding the residential energy efficiency financing coverage gap
   and market potential},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {260},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Access to upfront capital remains a primary barrier in residential
   energy efficiency adoption. Government-sponsored programs exist for
   low-income households while traditional financing serves creditworthy
   households. However, there remains a coverage gap for those with
   moderate incomes too high to qualify for low-income programs, but
   without access to friendly capital. With limited research in this space,
   this study aims to: (1) develop a model to estimate the number of
   households in the coverage gap; and (2) explore their spatial
   distribution. For the state of Michigan, we used data from the US Census
   Bureau and approximately 12,000 green bank loans to estimate the energy
   efficiency financing coverage gap across the state's 83 counties using a
   binomial mixed model. We found that credit score and income interacted
   to largely determine whether an applicant was approved. Households in
   the highest income quintile achieved a 50\% chance of approval with a
   moderate credit score (662) while those in the lowest needed a very high
   credit score (715) for the same odds. Overall, this created an estimated
   12\% energy efficiency financing coverage gap of households statewide,
   with individual county levels between 0\% and 24\%. Broadly,
   understanding the market potential and spatial distribution of this
   coverage gap could allow impact-driven financiers such as green banks or
   community development financial institutions to expand programs that may
   offer alternative underwriting criteria. Expanding loan access to this
   underserved market can promote energy system improvements, policy goals,
   household living conditions, and an equitable clean energy transition.},

Title = {A two-step approach to integrating gender justice into mitigation
   policy: examples from India},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {800-814},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Concerns over social justice cannot be separated from concerns over the
   environment, and vice-versa. Gender in the climate change literature is
   predominantly vulnerability and adaptation centric, with a glaring gap
   in research on understanding the relationship between mitigation and
   gender justice. Building on the insights from gender justice,
   environmental justice, and climate justice scholarship, this paper
   argues that mitigation policy should be conceived not only in terms of
   transition to a low carbon economy but also as an instrument for
   enhancing gender justice. To conceptualize such a mitigation policy, we
   propose a two-step approach, combining the works of Schlosberg, Fraser,
   and Sen. We argue that, to start with, it is important to identify
   relevant forms of exclusion, and then, in turn, to identify
   opportunities for ?parity of participation? of women in the mitigation
   policy cycle. This must be supplemented with identification of, and
   efforts at, building long-lasting supporting capabilities. Application
   of the proposed approach is illustrated through three examples from
   India: the National REDD+ Strategy, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna
   (PMUY) for cleaner fuels, and the International Solar Training Programme
   (Solar Mamas). We illustrate how the Solar Mamas scheme is closer to the
   proposed two-step approach and hence better integrates mitigation and
   gender justice objectives, whereas the REDD+ and the PMUY need
   revisiting with additional provisions and reconceptualization. The paper
   suggests that mainstreaming of gender justice into implementation of the
   Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement is
   a promising new field of research. Key policy insights Failure to
   consider gendered barriers to meaningful participation of women may
   limit the effectiveness of even women-centric mitigation policies in
   achieving their stated objectives. It is possible to at least nudge the
   social drivers of gender injustice by identifying and creating
   opportunities for addressing the androcentric foundations of exclusion
   and marginalization of women. Mitigation policies offer unique
   opportunities to go beyond highlighting the structures of gender
   injustices embedded in socio-economic systems to break the stereotypes
   of gendered-roles by recognizing women as key stakeholders and claimants
   in the new low-carbon society. This would require reconceptualizing
   capacity building for mitigation.},

Title = {Conflicted by decarbonisation: Five types of conflict at the nexus of
   capabilities and decentralised energy systems identified with an
   agent-based model},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores capability conflicts in the deployment of
   decentralised energy systems and identifies the affected population.
   These systems have positive societal impacts in terms of sustainability
   and consumer empowerment, but they are not accessible to all and their
   deployment may increase socio-economic inequalities. The societal
   impacts of decentralised energy systems can be understood in terms of
   conflicting capabilities; for some citizens capabilities may increase,
   whereas for others they may decrease. While problematic, capability
   conflicts may not be inherent. They may only occur in certain
   neighbourhoods, for example, where both affluent and less affluent
   populations coexist. By understanding why these capability conflicts
   occur, we may be able to anticipate whether these decentralised energy
   projects could result in societal problems. We use agent-based modelling
   and the scenario discovery technique to identify capability conflicts
   and the populations that may be affected. We distinguish five classes of
   conflicts, which can be used to anticipate social acceptance issues.
   Affected populations can be involved in the decision-making process to
   foster acceptance of decentralised energy systems. This work contributes
   to the growing political and scientific debate on issues of energy
   justice and inclusiveness related to the energy transition.
   Additionally, we contribute to the operationalisation of such
   capabilities, as this is one of the first papers to formalise the
   Capability Approach using an agent-based model.},

Title = {Deep entanglements: History, space and (energy) struggle in the German
   Energiewende},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to recent debates in energy geography, especially
   to energy transition research and literature, by developing a critical
   and empirically grounded understanding of energy transitions as
   expressions of contentious socio-spatial politics, past and present. The
   paper argues that historical struggles and contentious political
   practices around energy, so called energy struggles, continue to inform
   the ongoing and dynamic socio-spatial politics of energy transitions
   today and often manifest themselves in transition narratives. This
   analysis is supported by qualitative empirical materials derived from
   recent fieldwork in Berlin, Germany, which was conducted within the
   broader left-green movement for a socio-ecological and democratic German
   Energiewende. A historicisation of contentious politics and energy
   struggles facilitates an empirically robust framing of energy transition
   projects as dynamic, multi-actor, and more than eco-technical processes.
   The paper's contribution to energy geographies is threefold; firstly,
   utilising an empirically robust and historically sensitive analysis of
   the German Energiewende, the paper explores the deep entanglements of
   history, space and struggle in energy transitions. Secondly, the paper
   emphasises the need to understand energy transitions as constituted by
   energy struggles and contentious politics, past and present. Thirdly,
   the paper examines emergent spaces of energy democracy as part of the
   Energiewende and explores recent energy democracy demands as a spatial
   politics of energy transitions.},

Title = {An integrated, socially equitable design for sustainable water and
   energy supply in Iran},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This work deals with two interconnected transitions happening in the
   Middle East, firstly, the transition towards energy systems with a high
   share of variable renewable resources; and secondly, the transition
   towards water systems with a share of supply coming from desalination.
   This study aims to assess the impacts of these transition plans on
   social equity in a case study of the southern coast of Iran, where the
   community faces severe water scarcity and there is ready access to
   seawater for desalination. The main contribution of this research is to
   consider social equity as a key factor in the nexus evaluation of
   energy-water transition plans. Considering different system types
   (integrated versus separated) and configurations (centralized or
   decentralized, components, and technologies), it proposes interconnected
   water-energy transition scenarios with consideration of spatial and
   temporal changes. In order to achieve more realistic and sustainable
   water-energy supply planning, the study focuses on a quantitative
   distributive justice evaluation of the proposed scenarios, with
   consideration of related social equity theories and Iran's
   particularities, using the following proxy indicators: subsidies,
   taxation, job creation, NOx emissions, as well as environmental
   concerns. In the proposed scenarios with decentralized desalination,
   shifting a portion of job creation and subsidies for desalination and
   their renewable energy supply from urban areas and reallocating them to
   rural areas led to a balance in the distribution of benefits and burdens
   between rural and urban households, while addressing the issue of
   excluding rural households from the benefits and opportunities provided
   by renewable-powered desalination projects.},

Title = {The long term future for community energy in Great Britain: A co-created
   vision of a thriving sector and steps towards realising it},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Explorations of the longer-term potential for community energy to
   contribute to the energy transition can shape policy and practice today.
   However, much community energy research in Great Britain is currently,
   and understandably, focussed on short-term responses to the crisis in
   the sector induced by recent shifts in policy support. Therefore, we
   held a series of visioning and backcasting workshops with community
   energy practitioners and other stakeholders, to co-create a vision of a
   long term future where there is a thriving community energy sector.
   This paper presents the results of those workshops. Using the concept of
   business models to interrogate how community energy could be structured
   in the future, we find that the sector could diversify from its current
   focus on renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency, into
   new areas of the energy system: demand-side flexibility, mobility and
   heat. We also see potential for a Community Energy Confederation to help
   bridge the gap between the strengths of local organising, and the
   opportunities offered by larger scale activities. We identify the
   importance of actions by government - both at national and local levels
   - to realising this vision, in combination with the efforts of the
   community energy sector itself. Our research highlights the need for
   change in the institutional and spatial character of community energy;
   the sector's pragmatic attitude to the technological aspects of the
   energy transition; and its focus on community energy's role in
   delivering social and environmental co-benefits, in line with the
   concept of a just transition.},

Title = {Climate Change Mitigation Policies Targeting Households and Addressing
   Energy Poverty in European Union},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change mitigation measures linked to households' energy
   consumption have huge greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction
   potential and positive impact on energy poverty reduction. However,
   measures such as renovation of residential buildings or installation of
   micro generation technologies based on renewable energy sources have not
   realized their full energy saving and GHG emission reduction potentials,
   due to the energy efficiency paradox and other barriers. These climate
   change mitigation policies targeting the households' sector can deliver
   extra benefits such as energy poverty reduction and implementation of
   the energy justice principle; therefore, they require more attention of
   scholars and policy makers. The aim of this paper is to analyze the
   energy poverty and climate change mitigation issues in EU households
   based on a systematic literature review, and to provide future research
   paths and policy recommendations. Based on the systematic literature
   review, this paper develops an integrated framework for addressing
   energy poverty, just carbon free energy transition and climate change
   mitigation issues in the EU. Additionally, we argue that more targeted
   climate change policies and measures are necessary in the light of the
   shortcomings of current measures to reduce energy poverty and realize
   climate change mitigation potential linked to energy consumption in
   households.},

Title = {Blowing in the wind: A brief history of wind energy and wind power
   technologies in Denmark},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper explores the history of wind power technologies and the
   integration of wind energy in the Danish energy system. It does so
   focusing particularly on historical events, socio-cultural and
   socio-political changes and priorities that were important on this
   technological journey. From the first primitive wind turbines in the
   late 1800s, to the world wars, through the energy- crisis in the 70s,
   and into the decades of growing environmental awareness and concern,
   this historical account describes how policy priorities in Denmark
   gradually translated from the focus on energy diversification, energy
   efficiency and energy independence to the focus on sustainability and
   renewable energy resources, with wind energy and wind power technologies
   at the top of the priority list. Historically, wind power has been - and
   it still is - popular in Denmark. However, as the modern wind power
   turbines gradually grew to industrial scale heights, unchallenged
   support for specific local wind farms could no longer be taken for
   granted. This paper also touches upon the frequently tacit dilemmas of
   renewable energy technology planning and deployment, for example issues
   of environmental justice, wind farm ownership structures, and the role
   of social psychology for low-carbon energy transition processes.
   Notably, attention is drawn to the representation biases that may result
   in the emphasis of wind farm opposition / grievances in the wider wind
   farm related debates, where resistance to local wind farm projects might
   derive from minority opposition groups. Insights and lessons learnt from
   this Danish history of wind power may prove valuable and inspirational
   for other countries engaging in low-carbon energy transitions.},

Title = {Cultural imaginaries or incommensurable ontologies? Relationality and
   sovereignty as worldviews in socio-technological system transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scholars bridging the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and
   energy research in social sciences (ERSS) offer a rich and integrated
   conceptualization of how energy systems are imbued in social systems,
   including cultures, social structures, institutions, and social
   relations of power. Yet as fields of study, STS and ERSS are dominated
   by approaches to understanding nature, culture, and relationships among
   them with origins in western European Enlightenment thinking. In this
   article, we argue that the language of ``imaginaries{''} provides an
   understanding of culturally organized normative commitments but may
   obscure attention to what are actually diverse and sometimes
   incommensurable yet legitimate plural ontologies. Tribal Nations,
   Indigenous communities, and other non-Western worldviews are not simply
   imagined; they offer different teachings regarding the relational and
   embedded realities governing relations among human and more-than-human
   beings across time and space. The field of STS has a rich history of
   exploring ontological controversies and provides insight into
   understanding diverse and competing perspectives in science and
   technology, yet without articulating the connection between this
   conceptual terrain and the lived realities of socio-technological system
   entrenchment or change. ERSS recognizes participation, energy system
   democratization, and even co-production as components of a just energy
   transition, while most typically thinking about participation as a
   methodology or research approach rather than as requiring consideration
   and even wholesale reconceptualization of ontological foundations. To
   advance convergent, transdisciplinary social science research in
   socio-technological transitions requires grappling with plural
   ontologies regarding the reality of relations in the world. Here, we
   explore diverse ontologies shaping the realities of energy systems
   through the lens of Tribal Nations in the Great Lakes region in the
   United States. Ontologies that recognize reciprocal relationships among
   human and more-than-human beings as well as the sovereignty of these
   beings and their collective kinships suggest fundamentally different
   priorities for energy systems transitions. Moving beyond the language of
   imagination to recognize that cultures can involve diverse and sometimes
   incommensurable pluralistic ontologies is essential for developing
   inclusive and just frameworks for socio-technological system
   transitions.},

Title = {Reimagining energy futures: Contributions from community sustainable
   energy transitions in Thailand and the Philippines},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {91-102},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article counters conventional discourses where sustainable energy
   transitions in the Global South have been broadly linked to top-down
   policy frameworks, large-scale installations, and donor-driven
   interventions. It does so by highlighting the roles played by and the
   potentials of bottom-up, small-scale, and community-driven initiatives
   in shaping energy transitions in these locations. We shed light on two
   of these initiatives: a rural, community-based renewable energy project
   in Thailand, and a community-led social movement that prevented the
   construction of a coal-fired power plant in the Philippines. Both cases
   demonstrate how community mobilizations help facilitate sustainable
   energy transitions in the Global South, despite their many social,
   political and economic constraints. The analysis draws from concepts of
   local activism and community engagement on energy transitions, marrying
   the social movement concept of prefigurative activism with the concept
   of sociotechnical imaginaries in science and technology studies. This
   article highlights that valuable insights can be generated from
   rural-and community-driven renewable energy initiatives and their power
   to reimagine the futures of energy systems in the Global South.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {This perspective piece sets out to contribute to the academic and
   practitioner debates around energy transitions and democracy initiatives
   in the age of a climate crisis. For tackling present-day energy
   challenges in a democratic, equitable and just manner, critical social
   science and humanities research on meaning and materialities, new actors
   and narratives, values and democracy is indispensable. In doing so, we
   centralize our work around three fundamental axes: The Concept,
   reflecting on the energy itself and revitalizing its essence; The
   Political, embracing the value laden, political and gendered nature of
   energy, and recognizing citizens' initiatives as counter currents to
   centralized energy decision-making; and The People, anticipating the far
   right's post-truth narratives that jeopardize planetary futures. We
   contend that ``normative, political and embodied{''} research and praxis
   can serve for diversifying the energy transition debate as well as
   energizing bottom-up community led initiatives in order to democratize
   the energy playing field of recent times.},

Title = {Towards a Territorially Just Climate Transition-Assessing the Swedish EU
   Territorial Just Transition Plan Development Process},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The move towards a climate neutral economy and society requires
   policymakers and practitioners to carefully consider the core technical,
   social, and spatial dimensions of a just transition. This paper closely
   examines the processes undertaken during the development of EU
   Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTPs) for the three Swedish regions
   of Gotland, Norrbotten, and Vastra Gotaland. The aim is to establish
   whether the content and actions outlined in the TJTPs were driven by the
   technical, social, or spatial dimensions of a just transition. The
   analysis is primarily based on a socio-economic and governance impact
   assessment conducted in each region as part of the TJTP formulation
   process. These data are also supported by observations of the TJTP
   development process by the article authors who were part of the team put
   together by DG Reform to work with the preparation of the TJTPs. The
   paper finds that the TJTPs development process was largely driven by
   technical considerations, rather than spatial and socio-economic issues.
   This indicates that a more open and inclusive place-based territorial
   approach to climate transition policy formulation and implementation is
   required. A balance between the technical, social, and spatial elements
   of a just transition is needed if policies are going to meet the
   requirements of local and regional citizens and provide sustainable
   socio-economic growth and environmental protection, without risks of
   delocalizing energy-intensive processes to other regions.},

Title = {Strengthening Gender Justice in a Just Transition: A Research Agenda
   Based on a Systematic Map of Gender in Coal Transitions},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For climate change mitigation, a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels such as
   coal is necessary. This has far-reaching gender-specific consequences.
   This paper presents a systematic map of the literature that examines the
   impact of historical coal phase-out processes on women and their role in
   these processes. The search process consisted of screening over 3100
   abstracts and reading 247 full-text studies. The analysis of the 73
   publications ultimately included in the systematic map shows that past
   coal phase-outs meant both opportunities (e.g., increased labour market
   participation) as well as burdens for women (e.g., double burden of job
   and household). It becomes clear that agency within coal transitions was
   also gendered. For example, it was difficult for women to gain access to
   union structures, which led them to organise themselves into grassroots
   movements. Our research shows that policies aiming for a just
   sustainability transition should always be explicitly gender-responsive.
   However, the impact of sustainability transitions on women's lives
   remains largely under-researched. Therefore, we propose a research
   agenda based on our findings containing six key issues that need to be
   addressed scientifically.},

Title = {Using the capability approach to evaluate energy vulnerability policies
   and initiatives in Victoria, Australia},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1109-1127},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Energy vulnerability is a multi-dimensional, dynamic and
   context-specific phenomenon that poses a challenge for equity in energy
   transition policies. The Capability Approach (CA) is a normative
   framework focused on people's opportunities and freedoms, used to
   address dimensions of social justice. Whereas the CA has been used to
   assess and measure conditions of poverty, exclusion and inequality, its
   application to evaluate policies is rare. Building on work that
   establishes being able to heat the home adequately as a secondary
   capability towards being able to lead a healthy life, this narrative
   review maps the conditions and processes that shape this secondary
   capability in Victoria, Australia. It also evaluates local policies and
   initiatives aimed at addressing energy vulnerability. The map identifies
   structural, geographical and cultural phenomena and feed-back loops and
   exposes a hierarchy of capabilities for vulnerable households that need
   to be satisfied. The policy review finds that current efforts focus on
   mitigating inequalities in resources with little evidence for outcomes
   in security or transformative agency. Future initiatives may give more
   attention to the satisfaction of the tertiary capability of being able
   to live in an energy efficient dwelling, customise solutions to the
   multitude and range of conditions and acknowledge the need of warmth
   throughout the home.},

   in Japan.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {172},

Abstract = {This study investigates the sustainability and social equity impacts of
   the ongoing transition toward a low carbon society in Japan to assess
   the merits of top-down and bottom-up approaches.
   The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy
   expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese MARKAL/TIMES
   framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys
   identify householder energy system and participation preferences,
   alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design.
   Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes
   between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven
   approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental
   goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic
   sustainability evaluation process.
   Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent
   householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared
   to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive
   ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes.
   However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable
   outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through
   the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and
   affordable.
   The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design,
   and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals
   while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity
   concerns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The decarbonisation divide: Contextualizing landscapes of low-carbon
   exploitation and toxicity in Africa},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Much academic research on low-carbon transitions focuses on the
   diffusion or use of innovations such as electric vehicles or solar
   panels, but overlooks or obscures downstream and upstream processes,
   such as mining or waste flows. Yet it is at these two extremes where
   emerging low-carbon transitions in mobility and electricity are
   effectively implicated in toxic pollution, biodiversity loss,
   exacerbation of gender inequality, exploitation of child labor, and the
   subjugation of ethnic minorities. We conceptualize these processes as
   part of an emerging ``decarbonisation divide.{''} To illustrate this
   divide with clear insights for political ecology, sustainability
   transitions, and energy justice research, this study draws from
   extensive fieldwork examining cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic
   of the Congo (DRC), and the processing and recycling of electronic waste
   in Ghana. It utilizes original data from 34 semi-structured research
   interviews with experts and 69 community interviews with artisanal
   cobalt miners, e-waste scrapyard workers, and other stakeholders, as
   well as 50 site visits. These visits included 30 industrial and
   artisanal cobalt mines in the DRC, as well as associated infrastructure
   such as trading depots and processing centers, and 20 visits to the
   Agbogbloshie scrapyard and neighborhood alongside local waste collection
   sites, electrical repair shops, recycling centers, and community e-waste
   dumps in Ghana. The study proposes a concerted set of policy
   recommendations for how to better address issues of exploitation and
   toxicity, suggestions that go beyond the often-touted solutions of
   formalisation or financing. Ultimately, the study holds that we must
   all, as researchers, planners, and citizens, broaden the criteria and
   analytical parameters we use to evaluate the sustainability of
   low-carbon transitions.},

Title = {Community solar energy initiatives in India: A pathway for addressing
   energy poverty and sustainability?},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {210},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Sustainable technologies for social mobilization and community
   empowerment are contemporary phenomena of grassroots innovation
   movements. The origins of the grassroots innovations appear in the
   appropriate technology movement of the 1970s, the People's Science
   Movement of the 1980s, and more recently, the Social Movement
   Organization as seen in the cases of the Honey Bee Network in India and
   the Social Technology Network in Brazil. This paper articulates the
   community energy movement in India in the framework of `grassroots
   innovations for sustainability'. The paper presents three fine case
   studies of off-grid community energy initiatives namely, the Dungarpur
   Renewable Energy Technologies Private Limited, (DURGA), the Barefoot
   College and the Rampura Community Solar Power Plant (CSPP). The case
   studies represent three different kind of business models of community
   energy projects - a private limited company, a market-based model and a
   village energy committee (VEC) model. Therefore, they are representative
   of different grassroots innovations in off-grid energy projects. The
   case studies exemplify how off-grid community energy projects may
   manifest an embedded character of the grassroots innovations and address
   energy poverty and social justice concerns, such as community
   participation, equitable distribution of benefits, representation of
   marginalized communities. The case studies also demonstrate that the
   grassroots innovations in off-grid energy projects may enhance social
   mobilization, community empowerment and sustainability. To conclude, the
   findings of this research show that grassroots innovations in technology
   and sustainable development are consistent with each other. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Community energy is promised to contribute to a just transition and
   energy democracy. However, the results of a survey show low levels of
   diversity, and that it is particularly academics with higher income
   levels who are participating. Especially women and younger people are
   less engaged in community energy. It is shown that differences exist
   between age and gender groups regarding perceptions, attitudes, and
   activities. This infringes in particular the just transition criterion
   of intra-generational equity. However, there is substantial potential
   for engagement in community energy across age, gender, income and
   education level that could be exploited if the policy framework provided
   more support and if the concept was better implemented and disseminated.},

Title = {Acceptance of wind energy and the role of financial and procedural
   participation: An investigation with focus groups and choice experiments},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {97-105},

Abstract = {In the course of its transition of the energy sector Germany aims to
   provide 80 per cent of the power supply from renewable energy sources.
   Although it is projected that wind power will be the main contributor in
   the energy transition, due to its spatial implications it is targeted by
   considerable local opposition, thus jeopardising the success of many
   wind energy projects. Previous research has found that distributive and
   procedural justice issues are common factors influencing local public
   acceptance. This paper explores local public preferences for different
   forms of financial and procedural participation by means of choice
   experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects
   are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e.
   shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making
   process are offered. Policy recommendations are given on how wind power
   projects should be implemented so as to counteract local opposition.
   Deepening the understanding of these issues is of practical importance
   for future wind energy development.},

Title = {Normative Alignment, Institutional Resilience and Shifts in Legal
   Governance of the Energy Transition},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In Europe, the energy transition by means of a governance shift through
   liberalization is followed by a transition and shift towards community
   energy initiatives, with a particular view of supporting the demand for
   greater energy sustainability. What institutional legal consequences, as
   constraints and opportunities for lawful behaviour, follow from a shift
   in legal governance towards facilitating resilient community energy
   services? This conceptual article looks for an answer to this question
   by combining governance theory with Ostrom's IAD-framework and
   Institutional Legal Theory. A key aspect is understanding normative
   alignment (as institutional conduciveness and resilience) in relation to
   the possible shift from the current institutional environment of
   regulated energy market to that of a community energy network. The
   heuristic and analytical (design) relevance of the approach is
   illustrated with two policy examples contrasting the energy
   democratization and energy expansion frames, and discussed also in the
   perspective of energy governance experimentation with community energy
   initiatives in The Netherlands. Three scenarios of shifts in legal
   governance are identified. The key issue in legal governance design is
   the choice between these, particularly with respect to the integrity of
   institutional environments in terms of former frames to provide proper
   guidance to operational (experimental) activity.},

Title = {Rethinking energy demand governance: Exploring impact beyond `energy'
   policy},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {70-78},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The challenges of climate change and energy security, along with
   problems of fuel poverty and energy justice bring imperatives to create
   transitions in energy demand. Academic research and theory have begun to
   highlight the ways that government policies, strategies, and processes
   across wide-ranging areas of policy, from health to work and the
   economy, shape everyday practices with significant implications for
   energy demand. This brings focus on the role of governance in shaping
   energy demand far beyond what might traditionally be characterised as
   `energy' policy. Situating these ideas in terms of relational
   geographical concepts of governance, this paper analyses qualitative
   interview data with actors involved in governing along with documentary
   material, to highlight four different ways in which non-energy related
   governance can have important implications for energy issues. The
   central contribution of the paper is to set out a distinctive analytic
   framework for making visible `non-energy' policy impacts, which might
   otherwise be obscured within analysis. The article concludes reflecting
   on the implications of the analysis for rethinking the governance of
   energy demand to meet contemporary challenges.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Wind energy research is dominated by studies of local acceptance (or
   not) of wind farms and comparative studies at a national level. Research
   on the spatial differentiation of wind energy developments at the
   regional level is still insufficient, however. This study provides new
   empirical evidence for the extent to which regional differences in the
   deployment of wind energy are related to specific environmental and
   socioeconomic factors, by a statistical analysis of data for districts
   in the Czech Republic. Unlike previous studies, we found that the
   installed capacity of wind energy cannot be well predicted by wind
   potential, land area and population density in an area. In the Czech
   Republic, wind farms more likely have been implemented in more
   urbanised, environmentally deprived coal-mining areas that are affected
   by economic depression. It seems that in environmentally deprived areas,
   wind energy is more positively accepted as an alternative source to
   coal, and the economic motivation (financial benefits for
   municipalities) can have a greater effect on local acceptance, while
   public opposition is less efficient due to lower social capital and
   involvement in political matters. Based on these results, some
   implications for the planning and spatial targeting of new wind farms
   are discussed.},

Title = {The challenges of engaging island communities: Lessons on renewable
   energy from a review of 17 case studies},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Islands have attracted growing attention as sites of renewable energy
   generation, both for generating commercial low-carbon energy and to
   improve local energy conditions. However, significant challenges exist
   in achieving fair distribution in the benefits and costs of developments
   located on or around islands and in engaging local communities on
   proposals for installations. A broad literature exists on the merits of
   different community engagement techniques but important gaps remain in
   understandings of the particular challenges of engaging with island
   communities on energy issues. Based on a thematic literature review,
   this article examines general principles and considerations for
   community engagement on energy developments, features of islands that
   can affect community engagement, and how past engagement processes have
   sought to encourage community participation, gain trust, and manage
   conflicts over developments. The review indicates that island
   communities appeared to be particularly concerned with ensuring that
   engagement processes give adequate priority to securing local benefits
   and incorporate credible mechanisms for managing intra-community
   conflicts. The article concludes by arguing that islands provide
   important arenas for testing not just new energy technologies but also
   ways to improve the integration of justice principles into community
   engagement on energy issues.},

Title = {Caught between hope and reality: how citizens reconcile ambitious

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {Anchored by ambitions of economic growth and energy security,
   governments in developing countries are building large-scale energy
   infrastructures at a fast pace. While committed to making modern energy
   accessible to all, many are also reconfiguring their institutions to
   hasten the sector transformation into a market-oriented entity. In some
   cases, these ambitious agendas are also being pursued in the context of
   deteriorating infrastructure and supply shortfalls. The paper uses the
   Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to explore how political elites
   and citizens construct visions of the desirable future to be realised
   through large scale energy projects. After documenting how dominant
   accounts align with and diverge from citizens expectations, the paper
   explores how urban households reconcile the energy abundance large-scale
   projects promise with their experience of inadequate and increasingly
   expensive access to electricity. Furthermore, noting the absence of a
   meaningful and effective citizens engagement in the sector governance,
   the paper highlights the inherent risks of large-scale projects from an

Volume = {64},
Pages = {248-259},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Acceptance plays an important role in the successful adoption of wind
   energy technology. This article identifies factors influencing the
   acceptance of wind energy and selects those factors which have the
   highest relevance for wind energy acceptance in Bavaria. We decided to
   analyze the Federal State of Bavaria in Germany as its current policy
   governance decelerates the building-up of wind turbines in this federal
   state. Using a qualitative approach, the results indicate that the
   perception of political processes, such as the recent enacting of the
   10-H regulation in Bavaria, influences the acceptance towards wind
   energy, as trust and transparency in political processes are essential.
   In addition, the paper reveals the importance of the distributive
   justice, focusing in particular on the subitem envy, which can be
   considered on a neighboring or regional level. Additionally it reveals
   additional factors which are relevant for wind energy acceptance in the
   specific case of the analyzed federal state. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Policy challenges to community energy in the EU: A systematic review of
   the scientific literature},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In response to the ongoing climate crisis, many countries have issued
   policies to support the uptake of renewable energy. In the same vein,
   the European Union (EU) has issued a revised renewable energy directive
   in 2018. One of the pillars of the directive is the support for
   community energy initiatives, i.e. sustainable energy initiatives run by
   or with the participation of citizens. The concept of community energy
   (CE) has been linked to a number of advantages, such as strengthening
   local democratic processes or economic development for marginalised
   communities. The aim of this review article is to find out how past
   policies helped to overcome or aggravated transition challenges towards
   a higher share of community energy in the EU. To answer this question,
   we reviewed the scientific literature on community energy from the last
   decade. We analysed this body through a theoretical lens that highlights
   four main transition challenges. These occur in relation to 1)
   directionality, 2) demand articulation, 3) experimentation, 4) policy
   learning \& coordination. Our results show that visions and goals are
   important policy tools for providing directionality in the energy
   transition. Feed-in-tariffs (FiT) surface as the most important policy
   to support community energy projects and spark demand. We found very
   little indication for a link between community energy and explicit
   experimentation. Nevertheless, learning does take place amongst peers.
   Our review underlined the important role intermediaries play in
   facilitating policy learning and coordination. We conclude by presenting
   a number of concrete policy recommendations such as strengthening
   intermediary organisations and providing administrative support to
   community energy initiatives in case of changes in the policy framework.},

Abstract = {The path towards decarbonization promises many societal benefits such as
   reduced greenhouse gas emissions and new technological innovation. The
   adverse effects of policies that are helping to facilitate the energy
   transition, such as price spikes or job displacement, however, are not
   evenly spread across the population, and some individuals and
   communities are more vulnerable to possible adverse impacts than others.
   Here, we adapt a framework for conceptualizing vulnerability from the
   climate change adaptation literature to the energy context. We construct
   the dimensions of the framework, provide an illustration using the case
   of the renewable portfolio standard, generate a vulnerability score
   measure and map vulnerability across US counties. Our analysis shows
   that this framework can be used to identify geographical disparities,
   and should be further developed in future research to provide deeper
   insights about a just transition.},

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of wind farms in Germany has spurred debate over the
   environmental impacts of theEnergiewende, the country's plan to
   transition towards renewable energy sources. We explore the opposition
   to two wind farms in central Germany by local civil initiatives through
   the Foucauldian notion of counter-conducts and a related Analytics of
   Protest Framework. Employing qualitative interpretive research methods,
   including 27 semi-structured interviews, we examine how wind energy
   critics navigate practices and rationalities governing wind energy
   expansion in the context of theEnergiewende. We argue that critics
   challenge imperatives of environmental protection and energy justice,
   while at the same time reinforcing them. Struggles over wind energy
   manifest as struggles over the legitimate object of environmental
   protection and the ethical constitution of an environmental subject.
   Landscapes, both as habitats and scenery, gain impetus as the central
   tenet in the ecological agenda of wind energy opponents.},

Title = {Toward feminist energy systems: Why adding women and solar panels is not
   enough},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Growth in renewable energy does not displace fossil fuel use on a
   one-to-one basis, but rather increases the total amount of energy that
   is produced. As numerous scholars have argued, an energy transition away
   from - rather than in addition to - fossil fuels will require more than
   technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist
   perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding
   what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures, as well as a
   paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches
   have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work, as well
   as in climate change research. In energy studies, however,
   gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's
   issues. Although this is crucial work, the focus on women represents
   just one dimension of what feminism can bring to the study of energy.
   Feminist theory also offers expertise in the study of power more
   broadly, which is widely applicable to the full spectrum of energy
   research. This article outlines a feminist energy research agenda that
   addresses many aspects of energy system design, planning, exchange, and
   use. We analyze energy along four intersecting coordinates: the
   political (democratic, decentralized and pluralist); economic
   (prioritizing human well-being and biodiversity over profit and
   unlimited growth); socio-ecological (preferring relationality over
   individualism); and technological (privileging distributed and
   decentralized fuel power and people power). In doing so, we show that
   feminism is well-suited for navigating the tangled web of power, profit,
   and technological innovation that comprises human fuel use.},

Abstract = {In this empirical study, we explore the user acceptance of smart home
   technologies by asking: How do people perceive their opportunities and

   this have for future energy savings, sustainability, and policy? Based
   on a mixed methods approach involving three focus groups (N = 18) and a
   nationally representative survey of adults (N = 1032) in the United
   Kingdom, we explore the demographics, preferences, and risks of smart
   home technology. We do this via the lenses of knowledge and adoption;
   energy and climate sustainability; and vulnerability and exclusion. We
   explore how different classes of people-adopters versus non-adopters,
   high-income versus low-income, women and men, old versus young-support
   or oppose smart home technologies, have different degrees of knowledge
   and misperceptions, and reveal very different perceptions about the
   practices enabled by smart homes. In doing so, we show at times
   compelling links between smart homes and energy consumption, and
   possible negative impacts to poverty, inclusion, and empowerment.},

Title = {Energy inequity variation across contexts},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {309},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents a framework to identify which household-energy
   outcomes are more likely to display injustice. Inequity is more likely
   when variation is pronounced at the lower end of wealth distributions.
   This paper compares solar-panel uptake with four other energy outcomes
   using the 2019 American Housing Survey. Analysis shows that solar-panel
   uptake in the United States has mainly been by high-wealth homeowners,
   across racial groups. Housing wealth explains around 37\% of the
   solar-uptake difference between ``Black alone{''} and other homeowners.
   In contrast, there are large racial differences for having washing
   machines or dryers. In addition, uncomfortably cold home temperatures
   and broken equipment are more likely for ``Black alone{''} homeowners.
   Similar patterns are mostly observed for renters. However, ``Black
   alone{''} households in public housing may have been less likely to
   benefit from solar panels than other public-housing tenants. There are
   three main implications. Solar policies targeting low wealth, rather
   than income, have greater potential for reducing racial inequality.
   Also, policymakers could focus more on equality in solar-panel access
   for public housing. Further, there are larger racial differences to
   address in non-solar contexts.},

   from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy
   resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the
   decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem,
   Massachusetts, US, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power
   station. Cerrejon open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the
   Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now
   supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of
   these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But
   the regulatory environment fails to account for the different
   constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal
   remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory
   transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects,
   which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental
   harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to
   incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy
   governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary
   harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy
   injustice-by revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel
   supply chains-may help generate and unite powerful trans-local
   solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider
   national, regional and global energy politics.},

Volume = {117},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper sheds a light on how local conditions affect renewable energy
   innovation. As empirical case, we study an energy transition policy
   regulation in the Netherlands: the zip code-rose regulation (PCR)
   intended for community energy initiatives. Firstly, we analyse the
   capacity of the PCR to facilitate the accommodation of renewable energy
   projects by community energy initiatives. Secondly, we analyse how
   emerging area-based energy practices are feeding back into the energy
   policy system. Based on empirical evidence from a desk study and
   interviews with community energy initiatives and key governance actors
   we find that the policy does provide a modest incentive for initiatives
   to develop renewable energy projects under local conditions.
   Nevertheless, the policy falls short of allowing initiatives to openly
   seek for locally desired solutions and hence, to increase opportunities
   at a local level to develop projects based on local conditions. However,
   current difficulties with the policy are being considered at a national
   level urging for adaptation of Dutch energy policies.},

Title = {Wasting Democracy, Fueling Dissent: Refuse-Derived Fuels in Can Sant
   Joan (Catalonia)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {The cement industry is one of the most energy intensive in the world,
   contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. The use
   of refuse-derived fuels (RDF) in cement kilns is increasingly portrayed
   as a sustainable solution to reduce emissions while dealing with
   different types of waste. Nevertheless, the use of RDF in cement plants
   is contested by communities around the world, who are facing immediate
   environmental impacts. In this article, we examine the burgeoning
   movement against waste incineration in cement kilns legitimized as
   energy recovery. We start by revisiting the environmental justice
   literature, which laid the groundwork for the contemporary anti-RDF
   movement. Then, in order to highlight the energy dimension of RDF we
   focus on two energy-related concepts: energy justice and energy
   democracy. Through the case study of Can Sant Joan (Catalonia), we
   assess the suitability and usefulness of these concepts with the local
   movement against waste incineration. Our analysis suggests that the
   movement against RDF use can be further energized and strengthened by
   expanding into the realm of energy democracy. Both the anti-RDF and the
   energy democracy movement share a focus on the local scale, have similar
   typology of stakeholders involved, and favor a strong bottom-up approach
   while paying attention to unequal power relations. We also observe that
   these movements can mutually benefit from being better integrated with
   one another. Finally, we propose that a potential alliance between the
   Plataforma Antiincineracio de Montcada i Reixac (PAMiR) and the Xarxa
   per la Sobirania Energetica (Xse) in Catalonia, can mobilize fruitful
   internal tensions toward a more inclusive and democratic future.},

   hierarchical structures, and social imaginaries underlying
   decision-making in a carbon-constrained world. Three cross-cutting
   themes run across this special issue. First, the papers identify new
   ways of envisioning and creating low-carbon energy futures that engage a
   range of social actors. Second, the papers highlight the need for
   analyses that bridge the global and local scales. Third, this issue
   emphasizes the importance of dialogue across disciplinary perspectives

Title = {Knowledge, participation, and the future: Epistemic quality in energy
   scenario construction},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Constructing energy scenarios is traditionally an endeavour driven by
   experts. I suggest that an outcome of relying solely on expertise is
   incompleteness. Moreover, expertise, while being a necessary condition,
   is not a sufficient condition for epistemic quality and normative
   legitimacy of energy scenarios given the scope of transitions that
   energy scenarios entail, which includes substantial societal
   repercussions. Four reasons will be provided for wide participation when
   constructing energy scenarios. First, there are several forecasting
   shortcomings of top-down approaches. Second, to rely solely on expertise
   provides incomplete conceptualizations of energy and central concepts
   such as ?smartness?, in addition to neglecting normative views. Third,
   increased epistemic quality is an outcome of wide participation. A
   fourth reason is derived from the argument of inductive risks, stating
   that thresholds of evidence should reflect the potential outcomes if
   erroneously corroborating or rejecting a hypothesis. As energy scenarios
   provide input to decision-making having potentially large societal
   impact, they ought to be both normatively legitimate as well as of
   sufficient epistemic quality, components provided by wide participation.},

Abstract = {This study examines the regional characteristics of energy or fuel
   poverty in Japan through a new approach. i.e., evaluating energy poverty
   via the direct measurement of energy service usage. This measure is a
   kind of relative poverty measure in calorific value, with multiple
   thresholds reflecting the diverse energy needs of households. The
   analysis sheds light on several unexplored issues in previous
   literature. Most notably, the result emphasizes the role of kerosene
   (heating oil) in securing warmth in winter, especially in the northern
   regions, and highlights an ``energy poverty premium{''} in Japan on the
   unit cost of energy (per amount of heat). This study also suggests that
   the ongoing energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables should be
   promoted carefully with due consideration to the detrimental impact on
   the energy poor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The need for gender-based approach in the assessment of local energy
   projects},
Journal = {ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Local renewable energy initiatives, that involve the local population,
   can help empower the communities, economically, culturally, and
   socially. In many cases, the ambitions of energy projects go beyond mere
   electricity production and involve issues of energy justice,
   environmental awareness, and environmental citizenship. However. these
   aspirations are often forgotten during project assessments, or they fail
   to include local voices, especially those of women and other
   marginalized groups. Gender has been given little attention in the
   energy scholarship and especially during the post-implementation
   assessment of energy projects due to the belief that energy technologies
   are gender neutral and beneficial for the whole community. The present
   study, with a focus on two local energy projects with mixed ownership,
   challenges this notion. The two case studies are the islands of El
   Hierro in Spain and Tilos in Greece. A detailed survey based on a series
   of indicators drawn from the energy justice framework is used to
   evaluate women's perceptions. By following a feminist approach, this
   work draws attention on the difference experiences of women and how
   these are often not acknowledged during the assessment of renewable
   energy projects. Local renewable energy does not automatically imply
   energy justice and pluralism. More effort is needed from policy makers
   to include women in the decision making and to ensure a fair
   distribution of the benefits of the projects. (C) 2022 The Author.

Title = {Power in transitions: Gendered power asymmetries in the United Kingdom
   and the United States coal transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Major sustainability transition processes will be necessary in the
   coming decades to meet international climate protection targets. These
   transition processes will cause profound economic and social changes.
   The accompanying redistribution of resources could be an opportunity for
   society to overcome existing unjust power relations, such as gender
   inequalities, instead of reproducing these structures. To achieve this,
   there must be a better understanding of the effects of transformation
   dynamics on inequalities. Using the example of historical coal
   transitions in the UK and the USA, we first show how women are affected
   differently by the transition than men, and how they engage in other
   ways to shape transition processes. For our analysis, we use Avelino's
   Power in Transitions (POINT) framework, and draw on data from 60
   publications extracted from a systematic literature review on gender and
   coal transitions. In the second step, we use the relevant variables from
   the empirical analysis to add a new analytical layer to Avelino's POINT
   framework. This new layer, entitled gendered power asymmetries, provides
   a tool for the systematic analysis of gender issues in transition
   research. Furthermore, we derive from our empirical results first
   suggestions for gender-just transition policies.},

Title = {People and power: Expanding the role and scale of public engagement in
   energy transitions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Given the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy
   transitions are among the most important STS research areas. Evidence
   increasingly points to social movements and mobilized publics as
   critical drivers of change, including transformative energy transitions.
   Yet STS' focus on science and expertise can miss the significance of the
   public's role in leading and shaping energy transitions. This paper
   explores how STS considers public engagement and disparities between
   project-specific issues and broader energy objectives, such as
   addressing global climate change. Drawing on research about public
   participation, mobilized publics, and social movements, the paper
   examines how expanding the STS lens of analysis can ensure that the
   public's role in energy transitions is fully assessed and reflected. The
   paper also discusses future research approaches and avenues for more
   interdisciplinary collaboration, which will be advantageous in
   investigating transformative energy transition pathways.},

Title = {Positive energies? An empirical study of community energy participation
   and attitudes to renewable energy},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {612-625},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that participation in community energy initiatives
   may play an important role in enabling a transition towards renewable
   energy (RE) deployment by fostering positive attitudes toward
   renewables. Yet, little is known about how members of community energy
   initiatives differ from non-members in terms of energy attitudes and
   whether different profiles of community energy members exist. This
   article empirically analyses the relations between community energy
   membership and attitudes toward RE and onshore wind energy. Based on
   statistical analyses of a large-scale quantitative dataset from an
   original survey (N = 3963) conducted with two energy cooperatives in
   Belgium, it contrasts different groups of cooperative members with each
   other and a comparison group of non-members. Results show that members
   have significantly more positive attitudes towards RE than non-members.
   Results also suggest that non-members tend to be more indifferent or
   more uncertain, not more objecting, than members to wind power. Finally,
   significant differences among cooperative members are highlighted,
   illustrating the contrast between communities of place and communities
   of interest. The findings suggest a novel perspective on the benefits of
   community energy membership - to overcome indifference or uncertainty -
   that is relevant to foster a rapid and socially acceptable low carbon
   transition.},

Title = {Energy Transition in the European Union and its Member States:
   Interpreting Federal Competence Allocation in the Light of the Paris
   Agreement},
Journal = {TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Energy transition in the European Union (EU) and its Member States
   involves questions of federalism, which are subject to various
   perspectives. The distribution of powers cannot be properly understood
   using classical legal methodology alone because Articles 192 to 194 of
   the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) contain too
   many ambiguous political compromises. On the one hand, Article 192(1)
   TFEU (on the environment) and Article 194(1) and (2)(1) TFEU (on energy)
   enable EU legislation on energy transition through the ordinary
   legislative procedure, including majority voting in the European
   Parliament and the Council. On the other hand, there are significant
   textual limits for EU action in neighbouring provisions with a
   `sovereignty exception' for the Member States in both Article 192(2) and
   Article 194(2)(2) TFEU. This article argues that, in the light of the
   Paris Agreement, the allocation of competences between the EU and its
   Member States should, in case of doubt, be understood in such a way that
   effective climate protection becomes possible. Because under Article
   191(1) TFEU the EU is to promote measures at the international level to
   combat climate change, such an international law-friendly interpretation
   is part of a legitimate teleological approach. Economic theories of
   federalism and innovation research in the social sciences help us to
   understand which aspects of economic or innovation theory can promote
   effectiveness in this respect. It is necessary to interpret the
   distribution of competences in a dynamic way, thereby slightly shifting
   the limits of interpretation.},

Abstract = {Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is a pre-condition
   for sustainable economic development. This is the case in South Africa,
   where the workforce and entrenched fossil fuel industry remain sceptical
   about a transition to renewable energy. This article explores the
   complexity of energy regulation in countries with a deep-seated economic
   dependency on fossil fuels. South Africa presents a good case study of
   the challenge of balancing the environmental, social and economic
   imperatives of energy. It unpacks the drivers behind directed regulation
   towards renewable electricity. A painful, but necessary, ``just
   transition{''} to a low-carbon economy requires laws to phase-out fossil
   fuels, without exposing public funds to private profit seekers. The
   South African experience of renewable electricity demonstrates the
   challenges of regulatory uncertainty. Careful legal reforms are
   necessary to rid existing electricity laws of their inertia and achieve
   a low-carbon economy while ensuring access to affordable, reliable and
   environmentally sustainable energy.},

Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-35},
Abstract = {Community action has an increasingly prominent role in the debates
   surrounding transitions to sustainability. Initiatives such as community
   energy projects, community gardens, local food networks and car sharing
   clubs provide new spaces for sustainable consumption, and combinations
   of technological and social innovations. These initiatives, which are
   often driven by social good rather than by pure monetary motives, have
   been conceptualised as grassroots innovations. Previous research in
   grassroots innovations has largely focused on conceptualising such
   initiatives and analysing their potential for replication and diffusion;
   there has been less research in the politics involved in these
   initiatives. We examine grassroots innovations as forms of political
   engagement that is different from the 1970s' alternative technology
   movements. Through an analysis of community-run Energy Cafes in the
   United Kingdom, we argue that while present-day grassroots innovations
   appear less explicitly political than their predecessors, they can still
   represent a form of political participation. Through the analytical lens
   of material politics, we investigate how Energy Cafes engage in diverse
   - explicit and implicit, more or less conscious forms of political
   engagement. In particular, their work to ``demystify{''} clients' energy
   bills can unravel into various forms of advocacy and engagement with
   energy technologies and practices in the home. Some Energy Cafe
   practices also make space for a needs-driven approach that acknowledges
   the embeddedness of energy in the household and wider society.},

Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {917-938},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Unlike the vast majority of European capitals, and despite growing
   income inequality, descriptive measures of socioeconomic segregation
   seem to show a desegregation trend in Bucharest over the last two
   decades. Socioeconomic segregation and environmental justice studies
   provide completing insights of the intricated uneven geographies of
   social, economic and environmental disparities of post-socialist cities.
   And Bucharest is paradoxically the most populated and yet less studied
   of the capitals of Central and Eastern Europe. This paper explores
   changes in the patterns of socioeconomic segregation in post-socialist
   Bucharest, sheds more light on the relationship between neighbourhood
   characteristics and the patterns of segregation, and includes
   `attractor' and `repellent' environmental factors, contributing to
   combine environmental justice and socioeconomic segregation approaches.
   Despite the apparently continuous desegregation trend, and even when
   controlling for the presence and proximity of other predictors,
   environmental factors play an increasing role in shaping local
   socioeconomic segregation patterns. This would suggest the need for
   consideration of the environmental factors in public policies aimed at
   mitigating the social cost of the transition and residential
   segregation. This should also lead to use descriptive measures of
   segregation more cautiously and to explore the relationship between
   neighbourhood characteristics, environmental conditions and the local
   patterns of segregation instead.},

Abstract = {The development of solar energy has been depicted as a paradigmatic
   break in unsustainable global growth, largely because it is framed as an
   innovation with minimal carbon emissions. On the contrary, drawing on
   literatures from spatial justice and political ecology, including on
   authoritarian populism, this article analyzes the rise and fall of the
   solar industry and the associated failures of ``green
   industrialization{''} in Bitterfeld, East Germany-an area that is
   characterized by political, economic, and social peripheralization,
   marginalization, and the rise of the far right. The development of solar
   energy, we argue, is merely the latest iteration of an industrial growth
   model that is rooted in a similar modernist mode of development. Based
   on original mixed methods field research in eastern Germany, it argues
   that many of the same inequalities that characterize fossil fuels and
   ``gray{''} (de)industrialization-undemocratic and unsustainable
   industrial processes, the concentration of corporate power and profits,
   and externalized waste and pollution-are replicated by solar energy.
   What is distinct is the fact that such contemporary ``green{''}
   manufacturing processes appear to negatively affect a wider and more
   dispersed range of spatial locations, also denying these locales the
   benefits of accumulation, production, and consumption. This unevenness
   reflects the reconfiguration of global supply chains over the past
   thirty years and the nature of green production processes that depend on
   a wider range of inputs that invariably produce localized sacrifice
   zones. We offer a spatial justice framework for solar energy, zooming in
   at the manufacturing stage, to explore the multiple sacrifice zones at
   the different stages of solar energy. Finally, we highlight the politics
   of resignation that is the product and foundation of capitalist realism
   that serves to dispossess communities around solar energy manufacturing
   sites in eastern Germany and might feed into the rise of the populist

Abstract = {The transition to renewable energy generates significant conflicts over
   time when technical innovations allowing larger wind turbine
   construction coincides with spatial regimentation as energy governance.
   The interplay of space, time and money, we argue, is crucial for
   understanding these conflicts. Wind energy's spatial advantage of
   potential social co-existence of energy generation and farming gets
   eaten up by differently constituted chronoscapes and regional planning,
   resulting in local perception of renewable energy as a threat and
   encroachment and experts working against a renewable energy transition.
   Drawing on the example of Brandenburg in East Germany, we demonstrate
   that financial means is next to space and time the third utmost relevant
   factor for local attitudes towards renewable energy.},

Abstract = {Transitioning to renewable energy is an imperative to help mitigate
   climate change, but such transitions are inevitably embedded in broader
   socio-ecological and political dynamics. Recent scholarship has focused
   on these more-than-technological dimensions of energy transitions to
   help understand their promises and drawbacks. This article contributes
   to this research agenda by highlighting the importance of considering
   not only who benefits from renewable energy development, but also what
   renewable energy is for. We analyse two cases in Iceland, the
   Karahnjukar hydropower project and Hellisheioi geothermal energy plant,
   in which renewable energy was used to attract heavy industry investments
   in the form of aluminium smelters. Attractive regulatory conditions in
   the form of `minimal red tape', low electricity prices and an
   industry-friendly tax regime led to significant profits for the
   aluminium industry but questionable benefits for the state and the
   people of Iceland. Renewable energy development in this way put
   Iceland's nature to use for private gain, while marginalizing
   alternative ideas of what that nature is for. Our analysis underlines
   the need to pursue perspectives that recognize the complex political and
   socio-ecological nature of energy systems, which includes attention to
   the political economy of industrial energy consumption.},

Title = {Between straitjacket and possibility: Energy initiatives and the
   politics of regulation},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {14-25},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Following critiques that scholarship on socio-technical transitions was
   overly normative and emptied of politics, a burgeoning stream of
   literature has begun offering understandings of transition that are more
   informed by politics. Whilst fruitful, there is a tendency in some of
   this work to constitute politics as the background or contextual frame
   in which socio-technical change unfolds, rather than as a process
   central to its emergence. Collaterally, relatively little attention has
   been given to how politics emerges in the everyday practices and
   struggles of energy initiatives. Engaging with recent work in urban
   studies, this paper explores how political processes unfold on the
   ground. We argue that one key site for this emergent politics is the
   institutional and regulatory arrangements that energy initiatives must
   navigate in carving out their activities. We do not address these simply
   as an externalised array of norms and procedures that variously impose
   upon and impede the efforts of energy initiatives. Instead, we explore
   how initiatives' trajectories are shaped by and entangled with the
   institutional and regulatory landscapes in which they operate. What we
   call politics emerges in and is exposed through initiatives' everyday
   efforts to negotiate and respond to regulatory strictures and
   opportunities. We explore the regulatory conditions that influence the
   everyday practices of three differently scaled energy initiatives in
   Scotland, Spain and Germany, each of which is variously involved in the
   generation, distribution and sale of energy. Our paper considers not
   only the ways that institutional arrangements generate obstacles for
   renewable energy innovation, but also how they may open up certain -
   albeit limited - possibilities for action, in some cases with larger
   ramifications for how the production and distribution of energy are
   governed. However, we note that where such possibilities arise, they are
   heavily determined by the terms set by existing institutional and
   regulatory frameworks, pointing to the limited scope for crafting new
   kinds of energy politics under current conditions.},

Title = {Towards a just energy transition in Delhi: Addressing the bias in the
   rooftop solar market},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {160},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Delhi's rooftop solar (RTS) policy was announced in 2016, but RTS has
   not been adopted as much in the residential segment as it has been in
   the other segments like commercial and industrial establishments. This
   not only makes it difficult for the government to achieve its RTS
   targets but also raises energy justice concerns as it deprives a large
   section of the population from benefitting from RTS. Residential
   consumer segment in Delhi is quite heterogeneous consisting of sections
   that differ widely with respect to income, roof space, education and
   technological awareness. Thus, an effective dissemination strategy for
   RTS in Delhi would require customized interventions, suiting the
   requirements of these different sections of the residential segment. In
   this paper, we provide some suggestions for such interventions. The
   study shows that for an extensive RTS dissemination in Delhi, policy
   makers have to adopt a holistic approach and simultaneously address the
   financial, political, regulatory, social and psychological barriers.},

Title = {Do high electricity bills undermine public support for renewables?
   Evidence from the European Union},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {156},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The clean energy transition has long been framed in terms of its
   technological and economic feasibility. An increasingly salient
   constraint lies in its political feasibility. The transition requires
   vigorous public support to be completed. Yet increased consumer costs
   associated with the deployment of renewable electricity could make
   voters - and, by extension, governments - less supportive of it. As a
   result, overly aggressive government support for renewables could lead
   to its own downfall. To examine this threat, I document two stylized
   facts. First, the expansion of renewable electricity capacity has been
   followed by an increase in household electricity bills, and this has
   mostly happened because of energy-specific taxes. An increase of
   renewable electricity capacity by one within-country standard deviation
   raises a typical household's bill by (sic)5.7 per MWh (95\% CI: {[}3,
   8.3]), most of which comes from an increase in non-VAT taxes
   (+(sic)3.8/MWh {[}2.6; 5.1]). Second, these taxes have hurt popular
   support for aggressive renewable energy policy. An increase of non-VAT
   taxes by one standard deviation increases the share of people who find
   renewable energy too ambitious by 0.7 percentage points (95\% CI:
   {[}0.1; 1.3]). Climbing costs could therefore undermine further
   political support toward renewable electricity deployment and threaten
   its contribution to greenhouse gas reductions.},

Pages = {347-363},

Abstract = {Energy infrastructures co-evolve with and are enacted and acted upon by
   not only technical but also regulatory and institutional factors, as
   well as sociocultural contexts. As solar energy plants require access to
   land and the electric grid, the recent uptick in solar energy
   infrastructure features interplay with local specificities. This article
   thus examines the uptake of solar energy in Portugal at both the
   national and local scales. The purpose is to contribute to a timely
   debate on critical renewabilities and to provide valuable insights for
   the future rollout of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in Portugal. The
   study demonstrates that solar energy policy measures not only show some
   start-stop aspects of the utility-scale solar PV roll-out, but have also
   tended to favour large companies, rather than community or individual
   operators. Three case studies point to a range of public attitudes
   regarding solar PV roll-out and its underlying drivers that are locally
   influenced by land use and sociocultural contexts, apparently more so
   than by concerns of low-carbon energy transitions. A key point for
   future solar energy transitions is, therefore, that local communities'
   concerns should be understood and approached cross-sectorally.
   Furthermore, the intersection of energy transitions and justice must be
   considered from a multi-scalar, multi-sited and cross-sectoral
   perspective.},

Title = {The neglected social dimensions to a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) transition: a
   critical and systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) refers to efforts to bi-directionally link the
   electric power system and the transportation system in ways that can
   improve the sustainability and security of both. A transition to V2G
   could enable vehicles to simultaneously improve the efficiency (and
   profitability) of electricity grids, reduce greenhouse gas emissions for
   transport, accommodate low-carbon sources of energy, and reap cost
   savings for owners, drivers, and other users. To understand the recent
   state of this field of research, here we conduct a systematic review of
   197 peer-reviewed articles published on V2G from 2015 to early 2017. We
   find that the majority of V2G studies in that time period focus on
   technical aspects of V2G, notably renewable energy storage, batteries,
   or load balancing to minimize electricity costs, in some cases including
   environmental goals as constraints. A much lower proportion of studies
   focus on the importance of assessing environmental and climate
   attributes of a V2G transition, or on the role of consumer acceptance
   and knowledge of V2G systems. Further, there is need for exploratory
   work on natural resource use and externalities, discourses and
   narratives as well as social justice, gender, and urban resilience
   considerations. These research gaps need to be addressed if V2G is to
   achieve the societal transition its advocates seek.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A deeper, a more nuanced examination of Kenya's solar energy enterprise
   development has the potential to generate new theoretical and practice
   insights into energy and sustainability transition process in a
   developing country context. Based on a review of energy/sustainability
   transition articles on Kenya, East Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa
   published in select energy, sustainability, and management journals,
   this article highlights four issues and questions related to Kenya's
   solar energy enterprise development that represent fertile ground for
   further scholarly analysis. Firstly, how can transition policies be
   designed and developed with strong social and gender justice
   orientations? Secondly, how can market development be more effectively
   linked to the sustainable development of local communities? Thirdly, how
   can politics and power dynamics be better aligned with the transition
   process? Fourthly, how can the private sector work with greater
   collaboration with the public sector to achieve more integrated policy
   and market outcomes?},

Abstract = {While much of the research and investment on electrification focuses on
   technology and materials, the transformation away from fossil fuels to a
   more regenerative, sustainable future that relies on renewable energy
   also provides huge opportunities for advancing social justice.
   Unfortunately, society has so far underinvested in the research and
   development, demonstration, and deployment of social innovations in this
   energy transformation, so many electrification initiatives have
   disproportionately benefited wealthy communities and countries and
   exacerbated social injustices, economic inequities, health disparities,
   and further concentrated wealth and power. Energy democracy provides a
   valuable framework to identify and disrupt these trends and leverage the
   transformative opportunities for social innovation and social justice
   with electrification. As the sourcing and recycling of new and different
   materials required for renewable energy generation expands, social
   justice must be prioritized. To enable a just transition, investing in
   social innovation in how and where materials are sourced and recycled is
   essential.},

   change. In the light of such changes this article, and the special
   section as a whole, represents a distinctive departure from earlier IPE
   of energy traditions by collectively deepening our understanding of how
   the IPE of energy is changing: in scalar, material, distributional and

   scholars with energy, given its wide-ranging relevance to debates about

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {197-211},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Malaysia's gas industry has been undergoing a profound transformation
   that is imperative in ensuring energy security. The rising demand
   especially in Peninsular Malaysia and regulating prices of natural gas
   saw PETR-ONAS selling natural gas at a relatively low price that affects
   the Government's revenue collection negatively. This article
   contextualised the changes in the law and policy that concerns the
   management of gas resources in Malaysia. The journey from a price
   regulated gas market towards a liberalised market is explained. This
   energy transition process requires more than changes in the law. It
   involves the synergy of dynamics from various aspects to ensure that the
   ecosystem is conducive for the development of a healthy natural gas
   sector to ensure secured energy supply, while catalysing the growth of
   new industries and generating new revenues for the nation. The
   challenges and pushbacks throughout this journey are highlighted.
   Discussions show how the problems were tackled strategically within the
   political, social and economic domains, as well as the interaction
   between them. These interactions demonstrate the importance of energy
   justice in policy making. Policy decisions are made to balance the
   competing goals of various key stakeholders.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Renewable energy and social justice advocates are organizing around the
   potential for community-based democratic organizations to promote more
   decentralized, sustainable, and just societies. Within this movement,
   consumer-owned electric utilities are often seen as central actors. Yet,
   there has been little systematic investigation into why integration of
   distributed energy resources (DERs) varies across these utilities. We
   explore this question using literature on sustainability transitions and
   strategic action fields. Choices about when and how to integrate DERs
   are shaped by new interpretations of long-standing principles, existing
   institutional relationships, and a utility's political power. We
   identify how four divergent strategies shape distinct technology
   configurations with differences in physical scale, concentration of
   political authority, and distribution of economic benefits. These
   differences suggest that local technology ownership may not be
   sufficient to motivate change in some contexts. Policy addressing
   political processes and ownership scale may be needed to accelerate more
   sustainable and just energy transitions.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Climate justice activists envision a ``postcarbon{''} future that not
   only transforms energy infrastructures but also redresses the fossil
   fuel economy's long-standing racial inequalities. Yet this anti-racist
   rebranding of the ``zero emissions{''} telos does not tend to the racial
   grief that's foundational to white supremacy. Accordingly, I ask: can we
   address racial oppression through a ``just transition{''} to a
   ``postcarbon{''} moment? In response, I connect today's postcarbon
   imaginary with yesterday's postcolonial imaginary. Drawing from research
   on US-based climate activism, I explore how the utopic rhetoric of a
   ``just transition{''} is instantiated in practice. I argue that the
   racialized absences constitutive of what scholars call ``postcolonial
   amnesia{''} are operative in the anti-racist move to a postcarbon
   moment. This postcarbon imaginary formulates the vulnerability of people
   of color to biophysical disasters as the raison d'etre for
   infrastructural transformation. This, I argue, has the effect of
   overlooking the ways in which racial grief inheres in such vulnerability
   and the capacity of energy infrastructures to uphold racist hierarchies.
   I situate this ``postcarbon amnesia{''} in Anne Cheng's framework for
   differentiating ``grief{''} from ``grievance,{''} calling for renewable
   energy transitions that move away from enumerative grievances and toward
   a sobering recognition of racial grief.},

Title = {What can energy research bring to social science? Reflections on 5 years
   of Energy Research \& Social Science and beyond},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy Research \& Social Science (ERSS) emerged in response to an
   identified lack of social science energy scholarship. The first
   publication in this journal asked `What can the social sciences bring to
   energy research?'. Since then, ERSS has become a home for articles that
   have explored this question in a multitude of ways. In this Perspective
   we want to reflect, and stimulate debate, on the question we see as the
   other side of the coin: `What can energy research bring to the social
   sciences?' We develop our reflection, first, by exploring energy's
   unique features: what a focus on energy makes visible and thinkable that
   other entry points do not. We subsequently introduce a `menu of
   possibilities': areas of scholarship where a focus on energy has enabled
   or could enable different ways of understanding the world. We conclude
   with the suggestion that by changing the object of analysis, energy
   scholars can develop both new conceptual insights, and emphasise our
   connections with issues explored outside of energy scholarship.},

Title = {REST framework: A modelling approach towards cooling energy stress
   mitigation plans for future cities in warming Global South},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Future cities of the Global South will not only rapidly urbanise but
   will also get warmer from climate change and urbanisation induced
   effects. It will trigger a multi-fold increase in cooling demand,
   especially at a residential level, mitigation to which remains a policy
   and research gap. This study forwards a novel residential energy stress
   mitigation framework called REST to estimate warming climate-induced
   energy stress in residential buildings using a GIS-driven urban heat
   island and energy modelling approach. REST further estimates rooftop
   solar potential to enable solar photo-voltaic (PV) based decentralised
   energy solutions and establish an optimised routine for peer-to-peer
   energy sharing at a neighbourhood scale. The optimised network is
   classified through a decision tree algorithm to derive sustainability
   rules for mitigating energy stress at an urban planning scale. These
   sustainability rules established distributive energy justice variables
   in urban planning context. The REST framework is applied as a
   proof-of-concept on a future smart city of India, named Amaravati.
   Results show that cooling energy stress can be reduced by 80 \% in the
   study area through sensitive use of planning variables like Floor Space
   Index (FSI) and built-up density. It has crucial policy implications
   towards the design and implementation of a national level cooling action
   plans in the future cities of the Global South to meet the UN-SDG - 7
   (clean and affordable energy) and SDG - 11 (sustainable cities and
   communities) targets.},

Title = {Taking energy democracy to the streets: Socio-technical learning,
   institutional dynamism, and integration in South African community
   energy projects},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Energy governance is at a critical juncture: facing unavoidable change
   and also potentially restructuring the energy regime towards greater
   social justice, equity, and innovation. Energy democracy is a novel form
   of energy governance and an emergent social movement; as a concept, it
   may prove to be instrumental for assessing sociotechnical energy
   transition pathways towards the goals of democracy and decentralisation.
   This paper considers four possible energy transition pathways towards
   energy democracy by analysing two `socio-technical experiments' in South
   Africa. These `experiments' are both community-based renewable energy
   projects: a mini-grid pilot project by the state-owned energy utility
   (Lynedoch EcoVillage), and an off-grid solar utility using solar home
   systems by a social enterprise (the iShack project). Certain challenges
   were unique to each case - Lynedoch's primarily related to system
   design, while iShack's were the result of dynamic real-world conditions
   - yet both struggled with battery management systems, institutional
   disconnect, bureaucratic obstacles, and growing pains towards community
   cohesion. We argue for an expanded understanding of the four pathways to
   possible energy futures, taking into consideration the lessons and
   opportunities arising from these experiments, particularly regarding the
   advancement of technological innovation and the corresponding impacts at
   the neighbourhood level. Although the two socio-technical experiments
   discussed in this paper are micro-level interventions in South Africa,
   they contribute to the broader debate on sub-Saharan African energy
   democracy.},

Title = {Community renewable energy: What does it do? Walker and Devine-Wright
   (2008) ten years on},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In 2008, Walker and Devine-Wright published a short article that is now
   a key way-marker in the field: `Community renewable energy: what should
   it mean?'. A decade on, in this Perspective we revisit Walker and
   DevineWright's paper to re-examine its central themes and to identify
   opportunities for the coming ten years of community renewable energy
   (CRE) studies. Our Perspective takes the form of a series of paired
   reflections from the authors of the original paper and three early
   career researchers whose work it has influenced. We present these
   reflections in three themes. First, despite its fide, the 2008 article
   itself is not centrally concerned with meanings, still less what CRE
   should mean. CRE is always defined by its context, therefore, we argue
   for an approach that is alive to these contexts. Second, while the
   article splits `process' and `outcome' when conceptualising
   interpretations of CRE, research labelling elements of CRE as either
   `process' or `outcome' can obscure CRE's complex and entangled dynamics.
   Third, the past decade of scholarship emerging in this article's wake
   has tended to concentrate on the means by which CRE develops, rather
   than on its ends. There is a need for greater attention on the impacts
   of CRE, particularly its role in achieving just transitions. We propose
   that new approaches could further galvanise the study of CRE to help
   better understand what CRE does, for whom and in what contexts.},

Title = {Reconciliation through renewable energy? A survey of Indigenous
   communities, involvement, and peoples in Canada},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reconciliation is about the genuine restructuring and transformation of
   the relationships between Indigenous and settler people. Although
   renewable energy has not been inherently positive for Indigenous
   peoples, Indigenous communities in Canada have been participating in
   renewable energy production, which presents a potential pathway to
   reconciliation, climate change mitigation and a just energy transition.
   This study explores whether and to what extent community energy-defined
   by deep engagement in process, as well as local and collective
   benefits-relates to elements of participation associated with
   reconciliation, both conceptually and empirically. A conceptual
   framework based in community energy was developed to characterize and
   analyse 194 renewable energy projects associated with Indigenous
   communities. This framework considered `community' as belonging to
   traditional land, places where Indigenous people live, and as local
   authority, such as the Indigenous political organization of a settlement
   or reserve. Projects were examined by legal form, project location, and
   control. The findings do not provide strong indications of
   reconciliation. We suggest that one pathway to reconciliation is equity
   ownership, which has risen over time, although most projects located on
   traditional territories and Indigenous communities generally have
   minority or no ownership. There were no projects associated with Metis
   communities, and only 6 associated with Inuit communities. Institutional
   change requires implementation of free, prior and informed consent
   (EPIC) and extensive policy supports. Further research with and by
   Indigenous communities should examine how to support equity ownership by
   examining the findings of the 41 projects controlled by Indigenous
   communities and increased attention to Metis and Inuit communities.},

   our review, we evaluate how the borderland of energy geographies is
   evolving by mapping the geographic range of empirical studies, the
   processes and types of energy systems being researched and the key
   geographic concepts/theories engaged across the four main sub-fields of
   geography. We find that energy geographies scholarship has primarily
   centered on the Global North, remains focused on the extractive and
   production phase of energy development and is evolving across and within
   three of the four sub-fields of geography. Energy transitions,
   governance, justice, space, and landscape are key topics and concepts
   examined. Notable underrepresentations include a relative lack of energy
   geographies scholarship within physical geography, as well as limited
   studies that engage geographic concepts to study the transportation
   sector, unconventional energy development and the food-energy-water
   nexus. In part 2, we identify three broad research themes to expand the
   frontier of energy geographies: (a) geographies of energy knowledge
   production, particularly indigenous knowledge; (b) materializing energy,
   especially through engaging political-industrial ecology; and (c)
   advancing geographic thought by critically assessing how studying energy
   advances/challenges/transforms core geographic concepts and debates.
   Collectively, our review demonstrates that energy geographies have
   established firm footing within and across geography. Deepening
   engagement with emerging trends elsewhere in geography and the social
   sciences will not only help to better conceptualize what a geographic
   perspective on energy means but will also help to make clearer sense of
   the rapid economic, social, environmental, and political transformations
   currently underway within the global energy system.},

Title = {`Aha' moments in the water-energy-food nexus: A new morphological
   scenario method to accelerate sustainable transformation},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {148},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The water-energy-food nexus lens highlights the complex relationships
   and multiple sources of uncertainty that affect the achievement of
   global sustainable development. Such complexity and uncertainty requires
   future-oriented research that is effective in gathering experience
   across disciplines, sectors and scales. Scenario analysis is a proven
   method for decision support in conditions of uncertainty, shown to
   provide opportunities for learning that supports transformational
   change. There are, however, few scenario studies that examine the
   water-energy-food nexus. This paper presents a novel morphological
   method for developing and analysing transdisciplinary scenarios that
   cover the water-energy-food nexus. The method combines existing research
   to generate of a small suite of scenarios that are able to portray
   substantial complexity and multidimensionality, yet are fit for use
   within participatory research. The potential of this method to enhance
   nexus thinking is discussed, illustrating how it could provide a
   much-needed platform to support the transition towards sustainability
   across the nexus. By providing a platform for transdisciplinary
   dialogue, the scenarios disturb existing assumptions, reintroduce social
   and justice questions to the technical challenges that face the nexus,
   and build capacity for sustainable transformation. Further research is
   required to apply this approach so it can support tangible changes in
   decision making.},

Abstract = {Dominant agricultural and food systems lead to continuous resource
   depletion and unacceptable environmental and social impacts. While
   current calls for changing agrifood systems are increasingly framed in
   the context of sustainability transitions, they rarely make an explicit
   link to transition studies to address these systemic challenges, nor do
   transition scholars sufficiently address agri-food systems, despite
   their global pertinence. From this viewpoint, we illustrate several gaps
   in the agri-food systems debate that sustainability transition studies
   could engage in. We propose four avenues for research in the next decade
   of transition research on agri-food systems: 1) Crossscale dynamics
   between coupled systems; 2) Social justice, equity and inclusion; 3)
   Sustainability transitions in low- and middle-income countries; 4)
   Cross-sectoral governance and system integration. We call for a decade
   of new transition research that moves beyond single-scale and sector
   perspectives toward more inclusive and integrated analyses of food
   system dynamics.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {670-681},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decades after wind energy has taken hold in many developed countries,
   social scientists are beginning to understand the complex story of what
   causes differentiated responses to local development. Transitions in
   this literature include moving from attitudinal factors, and the
   infamous Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) explanation, toward place
   attachment, environmental justice, and how policy development might
   shape support for wind turbines in rural communities. While this
   research has advanced our understanding of some of the major questions
   in this area, the political arena has largely remained implicit or in
   the background, rather than a specific area of detailed inquiry.
   Addressing this gap in the literature, we detail findings from our mixed
   method study of interviews (n = 54) and surveys (n = 240) with local
   residents, developers, and other stakeholders in Ontario and Nova
   Scotia, Canada. We focus on the interplay of partisanship and geography,
   and how together they can powerfully influence attitudes toward wind
   energy. Specifically, we extend the existing literature and argue that
   when parties politicize the issue of wind energy - especially within the
   context of an urban/rural divide - it becomes intertwined with elements
   of ideology which can amplify responses and further entrench local
   conflict.},

   in poverty of Abuja, Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) are critical transitional spaces in
   urban informality that has deep-rooted implications on poverty
   alleviation efforts. However, current literature reports systemic
   injustices in SRH on access to essential services, including energy
   injustices. This study investigated distributive injustices in the SRH
   across three cities, Abuja, Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro, developing
   `energy cultures' narratives. It employed a computational social science
   methodology that used textual analysis, followed by a constructivist
   grounded theoretic approach to inform just policy design. The analysis
   was performed at two scales to identify and contrast injustices in the
   study areas. The result at an aggregated scale showed commonalities were
   around the poor design of the built environment, administrative lags of
   the utilities and high electricity bills. Case study-specific results
   showed that poverty penalties were linked with the energy cultures of
   each SRHs. In the Mumbai case, poverty penalties were associated with
   the aspirational purchase of household appliances due to move from slums
   to SRH. The Abuja case showed low power quality and load shedding
   frequently damaged appliances that increase the maintenance costs for
   the occupants. The Rio de Janeiro SRH case had injustices embedded
   through the adoption of inefficient appliances received as charity from
   higher-income households. Fuel stacking was also observed in the SRH
   that illustrated cultural identities associated with cooking energy. The
   conclusion was drawn to support just policy design by considering the
   socio-cultural context of the built environment, improving utility
   governance and promoting cleaner fuel mix at the household level.},

Abstract = {Can ecological distribution conflicts turn into forces for
   sustainability? This overview paper addresses in a systematic conceptual
   manner the question of why, through whom, how, and when conflicts over
   the use of the environment may take an active role in shaping
   transitions toward sustainability. It presents a conceptual framework
   that schematically maps out the linkages between (a) patterns of
   (unsustainable) social metabolism, (b) the emergence of ecological
   distribution conflicts, (c) the rise of environmental justice movements,
   and (d) their potential contributions for sustainability transitions.
   The ways how these four processes can influence each other are
   multi-faceted and often not a foretold story. Yet, ecological
   distribution conflicts can have an important role for sustainability,
   because they relentlessly bring to light conflicting values over the
   environment as well as unsustainable resource uses affecting people and
   the planet. Environmental justice movements, born out of such conflicts,
   become key actors in politicizing such unsustainable resource uses, but
   moreover, they take sometimes also radical actions to stop them. By
   drawing on creative forms of mobilizations and diverse repertoires of
   action to effectively reduce unsustainabilities, they can turn from
   `victims' of environmental injustices into `warriors' for
   sustainability. But when will improvements in sustainability be lasting?
   By looking at the overall dynamics between the four processes, we aim to
   foster a more systematic understanding of the dynamics and roles of
   ecological distribution conflicts within sustainability processes.},

   infrastructure decisions has important implications for the relationship
   between energy transitions, democracy and justice, but existing research
   is deficient in focusing mainly on single case studies. In response, we
   conduct a multi-sectoral, comparative analysis for the first time to
   assess how UK governments have engaged publics, applying a novel mapping
   methodology that is systematic, longitudinal and cross-technology.
   Moreover, our focus embraces mechanisms of consultation and support
   measures (e.g. community benefits) and seeks to explain patterns of
   change using a pragmatist sociology framework. Findings indicate
   trendstowards a reduced scope for public engagement alongside expanded
   encouragement of community benefits, but also important sectoral
   differences. On-shore wind moved towards giving local decision-makers
   significant control over decisions. Gas-fired power stations experienced
   continuity, with central government controlling consents and limited
   interest in community benefits. Fracking facilities received intense
   promotion of community benefits, alongside incremental moves to restrict
   local decision-making. We argue that the patterns observed reflect
   government beliefs about the scope for depoliticisation in concrete
   situations, in which the conjunction of technologies, sites and publics
   affects how and whether arrangements for public engagement change. These
   results raise challenges for how researchers seek to connect energy
   transitions and democracy.},

Abstract = {As the state of Oregon transitions to a low-carbon economy, households
   currently experiencing a high energy cost burden may be vulnerable to
   future energy price fluctuations. To identify areas susceptible to high
   energy burden, this study models household energy use intensity on a
   census-tract level in Oregon. Findings are compared with housing,
   racial, and sociodemographic characteristics to explore factors
   associated with high energy use. Finally, energy cost index is
   constructed and mapped to identify census tracts vulnerable to high
   energy burden for targeted program and policy development. Study results
   reveal that census tracts with higher level of energy use intensity have
   higher percent of older housing, low-income households, households
   experiencing energy burden, and populations of racial minorities and
   without high school diploma. This research advances our understanding of
   differences in energy consumption across diverse population groups and
   provides detailed information on energy use and energy cost burden for
   state-level policymaking.},

Title = {Distributional disparities in residential rooftop solar potential and
   penetration in four cities in the United States},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Single-family residential rooftop solar adoption in the United States
   has not occurred equitably across the country, nor across socioeconomic
   and demographic groups. In response, state and local governments have
   developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing
   adoption by low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. This study merged
   national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the
   distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level
   socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions.
   First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and
   penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop
   penetration distributed across non-LMI and LMI communities in different
   cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and
   local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as
   barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using GIS, bivariate and
   multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four US cities -
   Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, DC, and Chicago,
   Illinois - to understand both universal and distinct local
   manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in
   some LMI communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily
   translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential
   was in LMI communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and
   demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English
   proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated
   with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for
   expanding rooftop solar to LMI households and communities, understanding
   the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better
   policy development and implementation.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy policies are necessary for achieving carbon neutrality
   which is the main goal for climate change mitigation. The cities in the

   reducing carbon emissions through various climate measures including
   some measures for renewable energy utilization. We use multilevel
   perspective (MLP) and renewable energy frameworks to examine the role of
   renewable energy policies to carbon neutrality in the Helsinki
   Metropolitan area and base our analysis on various policy documents and
   semi-structured interviews. Our findings show that current renewable
   energy policies in the Helsinki Metropolitan area are weak and many
   challenges exist. Nevertheless, many options are available for improving
   existing policies. The cities have many opportunities to adopt various
   energy policy measures, including small-scale renewable energy
   production in building premises, renewable energy integration to
   district heating, demand-side solutions for energy utilization, and
   increasing budgets and subsidies to renewable energy production and
   enhancement of the social acceptance of renewable energy. Such
   additional policies are needed to reach carbon neutrality in the

Abstract = {Lanterns, homes systems, hot water systems and micro-grids based on
   small-scale solar have become prominent ways to address the energy
   access challenge. As momentum grows for this form of energy transition
   this paper draws together research on small-scale solar in six different
   countries - Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and South
   Africa -to argue for a need to understand how, when, and for whom solar
   provides energy access. It argues that an assemblage perspective can
   provide vital insights into the diversity and dynamism of energy access.
   The paper demonstrates that the diverse ways in which solar provides
   energy access is a function of the flexibility/fixity of the
   socio-technical assemblage and the de/centralisation of agency.
   The central thesis of this paper is that energy access is fluid and ever
   changing and we need fluid, easily maintainable, locally modifiable
   `assemblages' for providing such access. Using this perspective, we find
   three common features of solar energy access across our case studies.
   First, there are significant gaps between what solar projects are
   designed to achieve and what they deliver, which are highly contingent
   on the flexibility of their structure and the decentralisation of agency
   within them. Second, access needs to endure continuously. Third, to
   foster enduring access, projects should embed logics of improvisation.
   This paper is based on six separate qualitative research projects
   conducted during 2010-2016. It draws data from 482 interviews, 91 home
   tours and 12 group discussions.},

Title = {How to change the sources of meaning of resistance identities in
   historically coal-reliant mining communities},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper explores the sociocultural identity debate surrounding coal
   mining and coal combustion infrastructures in Aragonese coalfields
   (Spain) to better understand local and individual resistance to energy
   transition. Adopting the Touraine-Castells sociological perspective and
   using an interpretive approach and a qualitative research design with
   in-depth interviews, this article focuses on cultural attributes that
   give meaning to resistance and project identities under construction. It
   also explores how resistance identities are linked to climate and energy
   policies and proposes an analytical framework to understand and to
   design decarbonisation pathways from resistance identities to project
   identities. The following conclusions are drawn from this study: a) the
   sources of meaning supporting current resistance identities are similar
   to juxtaposed, legitimising coal-phase identities (occupational,
   class-belonging and community identities), are reactive and founded on
   coal dependence, solidarity and justice; and b) resistance can only be
   overcome by a sustainable territorial project with a social base, which
   is why the adaptive dilemmas of historically coal-reliant mining
   communities (HCRCs) must be resolved. This research paper demonstrates
   the need for innovative governance to promote a transformative
   transition that addresses the sociocultural identities of HCRCs in the
   design of ecological transition contracts.},

Title = {Social engagement and socio-genesis of energy poverty as a problem in
   Spain},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {286-296},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The current paper provides an in-depth analysis of actors' engagement
   and its impact on the conceptualization and social perception of energy
   poverty, its analysis and the design of energy and social policies to
   confront it.
   Energy poverty in Spain is mentioned from 2012, conceptualized in 2013
   and amplified, becoming socially visible, from 2014, when the phenomenon
   was quantified after the country deficient condition deterioration.
   Until 2017, the different actors express themselves through media,
   generating an impact that has been studied from a mixed design combining
   contents analysis with qualitative analysis. A triple analytical
   approach: chronological, thematic and `of actors' has been applied to
   487 journalistic articles and press releases.
   In conclusion, the actual impact of engagement is defined in three
   fundamental aspects: the establishment of a social base knowledge about
   energy poverty; the contribution to socializing and mobilizing dynamics
   which led to institutional response and decisions making at different
   levels of social and energy policies; and, thirdly, to the creation of a
   collective framework of understanding and confrontation of the problem
   of unequal access to energy resources, which has fostered debate and
   reflection around energy unfairness and acknowledgement of energy
   vulnerability.},

   Colombian hydroelectricity development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {69-78},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper offers the identification of the hydropower energy systems
   events that have led to ecodistributive conflicts in the Colombian case
   and other countries of the region supported by the socio-energy systems
   framework and political ecology concepts.
   The analysis of secondary information about the building and
   installation of thirteen hydroelectric plants between 1980 and 2010 in
   Colombia led to the identification of three consecutive time periods in
   which the conflicts generated by the installation of the mentioned
   plants exhibited distinctive characteristics.
   The social and political effects of chosen energy systems on
   individuals, organizations and communities can be diverse and vast, but
   are usually neglected by decision makers and national policy designers
   to focus instead on economical and technological aspects. The lessons
   from past Colombian energy transitions could be integrated not only into
   the current national policy debates, but also into those of other
   countries in the region undergoing similar transitions. Doing so could
   help to avoid or minimize the social and political costs of energy
   policies, obtaining reliable energy systems which hopefully will remain
   in the longer term. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Committing to coal? Scripts, sociotechnical imaginaries, and the
   resurgence of a coal regime in the Philippines},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Philippine coalscape emerged from state-sponsored support for coal
   that civil society continually challenges. This paper examines how this
   coalscape was produced from contesting sociotechnical imaginaries and by
   whom. The article highlights how the state circulated the imaginaries of
   support towards coal import, domestic mining, and combustion for
   electricity using the scripts of energy security for national
   development. At the same time, it also sheds light on how proponents of
   an anti-coal imaginary used their scripts of energy transition, energy
   justice, and energy democracy. Using primary data from interviews,
   supplemented by a review of policy documents, news reports, and popular
   articles, this paper maps the scripts that proponents employ to produce
   these imaginaries. On the one hand, scripts on affordability, access,
   and reliability have shored up the pro-coal imaginary in the
   Philippines, which, altogether, converge into a grand imaginary of
   securing domestic energy supply to address the country's economic
   development. On the other hand, the scripts of polycentric social
   mobilizations for just and democratizing energy transition against
   pollution, human rights abuses (especially on Indigenous Peoples), and
   climate action buttressed an anti-coal imaginary. Putting into the
   spotlight these conflicting imaginaries provides insights into the
   intricate associations of energy systems with the environment, human
   rights, sustainability, and climate.},

Journal = {ONE EARTH},

Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {As the world's largest coal producer and consumer, China's transition
   from coal to cleaner energy sources is critical for achieving global
   decarbonization. Increasing regulations on air pollution and carbon
   emissions and decreasing costs of renewables drive China's transition
   away from coal; however, this transition also has implications for
   employment and social justice. Here, we assess China's current
   coal-transition policies, their barriers, and the potential for an
   accelerated transition, as well as the associated environmental, human
   health, and employment and social justice issues that may arise from the
   transition. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway
   could reduce annual premature death related to coal combustion by
   224,000 and reduce annual water consumption by 4.3 billion m(3) in 2050
   compared with business-as-usual. We highlight knowledge gaps and
   conclude with policy recommendations for an integrated approach to
   facilitate a rapid and just transition away from coal in China.},

Title = {Drivers of social equity in renewable energy at the municipal level: the
   case of local Japanese energy policy and preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {397-412},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Recent research has allowed us to quantify the costs and benefits of
   adopting renewable energy in specific municipalities, but how do these
   outcomes vary among communities at the national scale? This study uses
   survey responses from 47 Japanese municipalities to model these impacts
   and identifies key technological, social, and demographic factors that
   shape which communities benefit more from the renewable energy
   transition. On average, introducing renewable energy improves social
   equity, any financial burden on electricity prices is born most by
   wealthier residents, not the poor, and towns are predisposed to benefit
   from renewables no matter the amount introduced. To improve these
   impacts, towns can increase the amount of solar they host, or they can
   adjust the amount of CO2 emissions, PM emissions, tax revenue, jobs
   gained, or unpopular renewable power plants in their town. However,
   preferences and demographics matter as well. Age, education, and local
   preferences in favor of employment and community development all
   significantly relate to equity potential outcomes. Policymakers should
   consider adjusting their local energy priorities using these levers if
   they hope to engineer a renewable energy transition that is both
   positive and popular for their constituents.},

Title = {Community energy meets smart grids: Reviewing goals, structure, and
   roles in Virtual Power Plants in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Community-driven energy initiatives are seen as important drivers of the
   energy transition. So far these initiatives focused mainly on energy
   generation and conservation. Recently however, some initiatives started
   to adopt smart grid technologies like Virtual Power Plants (VPP) which
   enables them to become involved in the distribution, trading and
   management of energy. By adopting a multiple-methods approach consisting
   of literature reviews on community energy and Virtual Power Plant,
   action research, semi-structured interviews and by mobilizing Family
   Resemblance, this article explores the community-based Virtual Power
   Plants as a novel model for energy provision. We identified five
   building blocks that together form a cVPP: the community involved, the
   community-logic under which the project operates, the portfolio of
   distributed energy resources aggregated and controlled by an ICT control
   architecture, and the roles communities can collectively play in the
   energy system by means of cVPP. Three practical cases in Ireland,
   Belgium and the Netherlands highlight the diversity of cVPPs, that
   results from different choices and trade-offs made by various
   communities in diverse institutional contexts. Applying the cVPP
   conceptualization made visible that the three cVPPs had to comply with
   the incumbent energy system, making it difficult to play the preferred
   roles in the energy system, operate on the scale of their community and
   to keep their own needs and values center stage.},

Title = {On self-interested preferences for burden sharing rules: An econometric
   analysis for the costs of energy policy measures},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {417-426},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper examines the acceptance of burden sharing rules that refer to
   the costs of the German energy transition, which is one of the most
   challenging and disputed national climate and energy policy measures.
   Based on data from a comprehensive survey of more than 2200 citizens,
   the empirical analysis reveals that the polluter pays rule has by far
   the highest support compared with the ability-to-pay rule and especially
   compared with the equal-pay rule, which is widely refused in the sample.
   Since the distribution of the costs of the German energy transition is
   largely in line with a polluter-pays rule, its strong support seems to
   contribute to the high acceptance of the energy transition at all. The
   main result of our econometric analysis with multivariate binary and
   ordered probit models is that not only some attitudinal factors like
   environmental values and political identification, but especially
   economic self-interest is relevant since (equivalent) energy
   expenditures have a significantly negative effect on the support of the
   polluter-pays rule and especially (equivalent) income has a
   significantly negative effect on the preference for the ability-to-pay
   rule. These results suggest that the use of distributional arguments for
   the criticism of energy policy measures is not necessarily value-driven
   on the basis of real perceptions of distributive justice, but can also
   be strategically motivated to prevent and combat economically
   unfavorable measures. Together with the strong general support of the
   polluter-pays rule, these results suggest that a sharp reorientation of
   the German energy transition due to distributional arguments is not very
   useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Towards spatializing consumer energy sustainability. Empirical findings
   about the policy and practice of energy conservation and poverty in
   Barcelona and North Macedonia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \& PLANNING},
Abstract = {The way citizens make meaning, take decisions, and act differs from
   expert-informed expectations encapsulated in policies. Inspired by
   spatial theory, we explore the divide between official and everyday
   framings of consumer energy sustainability that is potentially limiting
   citizen engagement. Our argument draws from contrasting official and
   everyday framings encountered in narratives and practices related to (a)
   energy conservation in commercial buildings in Barcelona, and (b)
   household energy poverty in North Macedonia. Our interpretation reveals
   a major difference between official and everyday framings, whereby the
   former decontextualize practices and the latter knock down spatial
   borders to engage with energy through a wide array of material
   interventions and social structures that are not specific to
   intervention sites and policy matters. Everyday narratives reveal a
   spatial critique of the inconsistencies in official policy and practice
   that highlights the existence of systemic unequal participation,
   inequalities, and injustice. The appraisal of these inconsistencies
   limits the legitimacy of government and corporations, as well as the
   appeal of official policies and practices. The spatialization of energy
   consumption according to everyday epistemologies, whereby practices are
   appraised in their socio-material context calls for re-politicizing
   energy consumption in accordance with conceptions of energy citizenship
   - i.e. embracing its original grounding on bottom-up knowledge formation
   and political struggle.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Transitions towards sustainability are urgently needed to address the
   interconnected challenges of economic development, ecological integrity,
   and social justice, from local to global scales. Around the world,
   collaborative science-society initiatives are forming to conduct
   experiments in support of sustainability transitions. Such experiments,
   if carefully designed, provide significant learning opportunities for
   making progress on transition efforts. Yet, there is no broadly
   applicable evaluative scheme available to capture this critical
   information across a large number of cases, and to guide the design of
   transition experiments. To address this gap, the article develops such a
   scheme, in a tentative form, drawing on evaluative research and
   sustainability transitions scholarship, alongside insights from
   empirical cases. We critically discuss the scheme's key features of
   being generic, comprehensive, operational, and formative. Furthermore,
   we invite scholars and practitioners to apply, reflect and further
   develop the proposed tentative scheme making evaluation and experiments
   objects of learning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Energy Union aims to provide clean, secure, and affordable energy for
   many customers leading societies towards sustainable energy development.
   Several criteria were introduced in this vein to evaluate the
   twenty-third EU countries' progress towards energy union goals. The
   present study proposed and applied a SWARA-TOPSIS framework based on
   Pythagorean fuzzy sets to rank the EU members considering their
   sustainable energy development progress. Ten experts working in various
   fields were selected to support the identified criteria, and a
   sensitivity analysis based on twenty scenarios was performed to evaluate
   the proposed model's sensitivity to weight changes. The obtained results
   indicated that ``energy affordability{''} is the most influential
   criterion for evaluating countries, and the proposed model is sensitive
   to weight changes. Luxembourg is also the first-ranked country, followed
   by Denmark and Sweden, while Bulgaria achieved the worst rank among the
   EU considering its progress towards the energy union goals. The analysis
   of the results indicates room for improvement in implementation with the
   European Union goals by the EU members and the need to consider energy
   justice and affordability in the policy development, especially in the
   new members of the EU.},

Title = {Phasing out an embedded technology: Insights from banning the
   incandescent light bulb in Europe},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Opening up the dynamics of phase-outs is important to advance the
   knowledge about how to navigate phaseouts, how to speed them up and how
   to ensure justice, all pressing topics in energy transitions. I revisit
   the case of the incandescent light bulb phase-out in Europe and
   investigate what processes were involved after the phase-out regulation
   entered into force (2000-2020). The present study deviates in approach
   and analytical focus from prior studies of the light bulb phase-out. I
   use `technologies-in-practice' as heuristic to trace technology as a
   processual phenomenon, i.e. as an outcome of processes of co-evolving
   materiality, meanings, activities and skills integral to them.
   I find that intentional push for a destabilising meaning (energy
   inefficiency) of the light bulb, resonant with powerful larger discourse
   (climate change), and imitation of existing technology by a group of
   stakeholders was key in the process of light bulb's downscaling. The
   attachment of new, reinforcing the stability of the configuration,
   meanings to the light bulb (nostalgic lamp, rough-service lamp) by
   another group of stakeholders prevented a complete phase-out. I
   contribute to the existing theoretical literature by offering to put
   more emphasis on studying the later stages of the technological
   trajectory, and discussing the winners and losers of the phasing out.},

Title = {How public values theory can influence energy infrastructure planning:
   Exploring values articulation, time horizons, and substitutability
   through the Atlantic Coast pipeline},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The transformation of energy infrastructure in the United States,
   specifically the expansion of the transportation network of natural gas
   pipelines, is garnering more public attention than ever before. Once
   built, energy infrastructure is long-lasting and exerts a strong
   influence on economic conditions, environmental integrity, and social
   behavior. Yet, clear, strategic energy plans are lacking and federal
   permitting focuses on economic factors. This research explores how
   public values theory can be operationalized to include noneconomic
   factors into planning for the transformation of energy infrastructure.
   However, there is a paucity of mechanisms to incorporate noneconomic
   values into decision-making processes related to energy infrastructure.
   Work remains to bridge theory and practice such that public values can
   shape planning and permitting processes. This research presents a case
   study on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, drawing upon survey data
   from 268 people and three workshops with 15 participants to inform the
   ongoing national debate on energy infrastructure. The survey analysis
   suggests three key determinants for pipeline infrastructure as
   illustrated by: i) models of scale (size and the proportional risk); ii)
   eminent domain (taking lands); and iii) protectionism ({''}Not In My
   BackYard,{''} or NIMBY). This research also showcases three alternative
   approaches on how to foster deliberative democratic processes with
   community members. This research extends the theoretical construct of
   public values theory by articulating mechanisms of action and assessing
   the efficacy of those mechanisms. Strategic planning for energy
   transitions and finding ways to reduce conflict may, in the long-term,
   minimize construction costs and address local concerns.},

   vulnerability, poverty, and exclusion in the United States},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using bibliometric methods, we examine the persistently high energy
   bills borne by low-income households in the U.S. This is a mystifying
   problem in today's age of abundant and low-priced electricity and fossil
   fuels. After decades of energy-efficiency programs and targeted
   policies, the average low-income household still spends a
   disproportionately large percentage of its income on energy bills.
   Issues of equity, race and justice are increasingly linked to the
   problem of persistent energy burdens. In the complex ecosystem of
   stakeholders that influence energy burden, key gaps still exist in the
   understanding of causes and solutions. In particular, limited research
   has examined the role of landlords and property managers in multifamily
   housing. Over the past decade, research has increasingly illuminated (1)
   the link between energy burden and health, (2) promising pathways to
   democratize energy efficiency and rooftop solar, and (3) issues of
   equity, justice, and African American populations. Sustainable and
   affordable household energy is critical today as Covid-19 and climate
   change introduce new layers of stress that challenge the transition to a
   clean energy future.},

Title = {Is off-grid residential solar power inclusive? Solar power adoption,
   energy poverty, and social inequality in India},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With India's soaring energy demand and inadequate access to grid
   electricity in rural areas, off-grid solar power is a potential
   alternative for tackling India's energy poverty and inequality. However,
   little knowledge exists on: (1) the spatio-temporal pattern of solar
   power adoption by the residential sector in rural areas of India, (2)
   the extent to which solar power has alleviated (a) energy poverty, and
   (b) energy access inequality. Using panel data from approximately 9000
   rural residents in six energy-poor Indian states, we compare the solar
   power adoption rate across states over time (2015 and 2018), examine the
   contribution of solar power for alleviating energy poverty, and identify
   socio-economic characteristics of adopters. The average solar energy
   adoption rate was nine percent in 2018, five percentage points higher
   than in 2015, with the highest adoption rate in Bihar, followed by Uttar
   Pradesh and Odisha. This growth was driven primarily by solar lantern
   uptake, with the use of solar home systems only growing by less than one
   percentage point. Solar energy adoption significantly contributed to
   energy poverty alleviation but was limited to improving illumination.
   Solar home system adoption improved the use of electronic appliances
   among adopters but did not significantly increase radio/television use.
   Solar power played a limited role in energy inequality alleviation.
   Lower caste, poor households, and day laborers are less likely to adopt
   solar power and less aware of the availability of solar power as a
   residential energy source than higher caste, non-poor households, and
   self-employed farmers, traders, and salaried employees.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rhetoric of the lust transition' lies at the heart of energy and
   development policies internationally. In this context, it is crucial
   that communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction and production for
   employment do not become `victims' of the decarbonisation process. This
   paper involves a theoretically and conceptually grounded comparative
   analysis of policy measures that have been introduced in three first
   world jurisdictions which have been dependent on coal for employment
   North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Alberta in Canada and Victoria in
   Australia. In so doing, measures which have successfully ameliorated the
   socio-economic well-being of coal dependent communities are identified
   and a framework for successful just transition is proposed. Recognising,
   but notwithstanding, inherent power dynamics, the framework identifies
   an important role for government in assisting workers and communities in
   navigating the transition process and in supporting new and emerging
   low-carbon industries in the context of `strong' sustainable
   development.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {949-962},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Divestment campaigners are relatively new entrants to climate activism
   but have already made important contributions to the efforts of their
   climate movement allies. Through their strategy of directly targeting
   those financial actors responsible for the funding of fossil fuel
   production, they now play an increasingly key role in the
   decarbonization project. Despite these efforts divestment faces
   significant constraints. These constraints are illustrated in our study
   of the anti-Carmichael mine campaign in Australia. While the persistent
   campaign of divestment actors helped convince many financiers to decline
   funding the mine, in the end the mine was approved to proceed. This is
   no surprise, given the on-going resilience of fossil fuel financing and
   of the energy regime that sustains it. To understand the key elements of
   this resilience, and how it impacts divestment strategy, this paper
   situates divestment more directly in the contemporary globalized
   political economy and in the related politics of energy regime
   incumbency. The findings apply both to our specific Australian case and
   to the politics of divestment more broadly. Policy Insights
   The continued funding of fossil fuel production highlights the
   limitations of national and international climate policy negotiations to
   achieve significant change. Divestment addresses these policy
   disappointments through its direct targeting of the financing of fossil
   fuel production. The Carmichael coal mining case in Australia highlights
   the constraints climate actors confront in shifting climate policy
   decision-making away from incumbent energy regime actors - both
   financial and political. The case's trajectory raises both national and
   global climate policy implications, particularly the on-going resilience
   of fossil fuel financing and the networks and practices that sustain it.},

Title = {Social identity in the energy transition: an analysis of the ``Stop
   Adani Convoy{''} to explore social-political conflict in Australia},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Australia is undergoing an energy transition, largely spurred by efforts
   toward decarbonisation prompted by climate change. The energy
   transition, though, is socially and politically complex, particularly
   where the transition is felt most viscerally such as in
   resource-dependent regional communities. In this paper, I explore the
   social-political dimension of the energy transition in Australia by
   analysing a specific episode of social-political conflict: a multi-week,
   moving protest against a large thermal coal mine currently planned for
   development in Queensland, Australia, Adani Mining's Carmichael Coal
   Mine. The contestation was related to an `Anti-Adani Convoy' that
   travelled from the southern-most state of Australia, Tasmania, to the
   regional Queensland community, Clermont, nearest the proposed mine site
   in mid-2019. The analysis is grounded in the social psychology tradition
   of the Social Identity Approach, and applies a model for exploring how
   social context makes salient certain identities and norms (the Situated
   Identity Enactment model). Social identity dimensions are explored via
   qualitative coding of online news media reporting on the Convoy, and
   from this analysis identity-based insights are drawn regarding the
   social-political dynamics of the energy transition in Australia. The
   Convoy experience indicates that regional communities are unlikely to be
   convinced about the need for the energy transition--or decarbonisation
   specifically and climate action more broadly--by advocates from afar who
   adopt tactics that appear as a threat to one group from another group.
   Instead, the energy transition will be best served by place-based,
   bottom-up initiatives that are congruent with local identity, values,
   preferences, and priorities.},

Abstract = {Digital energy platforms play a central role in the transition toward a

   effect of digital energy platforms on public values. We developed and
   tested a novel public value framework, combining values already embedded
   in energy and digitalization regulations and emerging values that have
   become more relevant in recent debates. We analyzed value changes and
   potential value tensions. We found that sustainability is prioritized,
   security is broadened to include cybersecurity, and values relevant for
   digital technologies, such as control over technology, have also become
   relevant for the energy system. This has resulted in three value
   tensions: preserving a well-functioning energy system,
   self-determination, and ensuring a level playing field and public
   control. A sustainable energy system requires governments to address
   these value changes, value tensions, and connected societal and
   political challenges related to the implementation of digital energy
   platforms.},

Title = {The future is flexible? Exploring expert visions of energy system
   decarbonisation},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Decarbonising the energy system means moving from a centralised, fossil
   fuel-dependent one to one based primarily on renewable energy. Visions
   of whole system change focus on sociotechnical concepts like
   electrification and flexibility, rather than single technologies such as
   nuclear or solar. The role that technological niches might play in
   relation to such systemic sociotechnical visions is under-researched.
   Traditionally, technological niches are thought to nurture new
   `proto-regimes', supported by coherent visions of how technologies will
   help solve problems within existing socio-technical regimes. However,
   the relationship between socio-technical visions like flexibility and
   individual demonstrator projects is more complex. Interviews with
   experts from the FLEXIS energy systems project (south Wales, UK) show
   how future visions associated with a range of demonstrator projects are
   being developed against the backdrop of a system-level vision of a
   flexible, multi-vector energy system. Interview data also shows how the
   development of visions for demonstrators draws on social learning about
   place and societal values overlooked in systemic visions. Such social
   learning can incorporate critical reflection on key assumptions that
   underlie dominant system-level visions. The extent such learning is
   possible through the development of potential niches, however, is
   subject to limitations that invite further research.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {38},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With this paper, I want to raise attention to the value of social
   conflict in energy policy and planning, and the limitations of
   participatory processes for including different normative appraisals in
   energy policy and planning. I first discuss three perspectives on the
   value of social conflict. Although invited participation is generally
   considered as a way to ameliorate, or anticipate social conflict on
   energy projects, this `participatory reflex' goes past the fact that
   social conflict can itself be considered a form of participation, i.e.
   self-organized participation. Second, I discuss two basic
   characteristics of social conflict that show the limitations of invited
   participation in identifying and including divergent normative
   appraisals: 1) social conflict challenges institutions, and 2) social
   conflict involves emergent positions and groups. I propose to see social
   conflict as self-organized participation that serves as an source for
   identification and inclusion of normative appraisals in energy policy
   and planning. This not only necessitates the study of these phenomena as
   such, but also suggests a different approach to deal with such phenomena
   in research and practice. I will lay out three directions for further
   research.},

Title = {African energy poverty: a moving target},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Historically, `energy poverty' in Sub-Saharan Africa has been understood
   in relatively static terms and its solutions largely understood as a
   modernist state-led project of expanding centralised distribution to
   achieve a coordinated `transition' from traditional fuels. In recent
   decades, however, political economies of energy in the region have
   exhibited considerable dynamism, changing what energy poverty looks
   like. The rapid dissemination of mobile phones, for example, has meant
   that most households now require near daily access to some form of
   electricity, inducing creative local responses. As well, with increased
   Sino-African trade, a plethora of cheap lighting products such as
   dry-cell battery torches and small-scale solar products have become
   widely available, reducing consumer interest in kerosene lamps and fuel.
   Finally, charcoal has emerged as a key cooking fuel for growing urban
   populations-introducing a new/expanded source of rural revenue while
   disrupting a decades long official campaign to induce `transition' from
   firewood to LPG. We demonstrate how these particular changes are
   occurring through the example of dynamics in Sierra Leone in West
   Africa.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-473},

Abstract = {The corporate control of energy production and the reach of fossil
   capital into civil and political society can be understood as a regime
   of obstruction that is preventing necessary action on climate change and
   blocking a just energy transition. In addition to overt forms of
   economic power and influence, hegemonic power is central to the fossil
   fuel industry's regime of obstruction. Based on 29 interviews and an
   analysis of third-party teaching resources, this article shows how
   teaching practices and resources work to centre, legitimize, and
   entrench a set of beliefs relating to climate change, energy, and
   environmentalism that align with the interests of fossil fuel industry
   actors in Saskatchewan, Canada. We argue that these pedagogical
   practices promote student subjectivities consistent with neoliberal
   environmentalism centred on individual actions designed to insulate
   fossil fuel industries from criticism and dissuade young people from
   questioning or understanding the role of corporate power in the climate
   crisis. Furthermore, this petro-pedagogy intends to restrict the
   imagination of possible climate solutions to individual acts of
   conservation that fail to challenge the structural growth of fossil fuel
   consumption. This paper advances these teaching practices and resources
   as a `pedagogical arm' of the regime of obstruction.},

Title = {Grassroots retrofit: Community governance and residential energy
   transitions in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Residential energy demand accounts for a significant proportion of the
   UK's carbon emissions. As similar to 80\% of the existing housing stock
   is expected to be in use by 2050, low carbon retrofit is essential in
   meeting climate and fuel poverty targets. Recent policy has failed to
   deliver retrofit at scale, leading to an emerging movement of grassroots
   initiatives approaching the challenge through community governance. This
   paper explores the role of these grassroots initiatives in the UK,
   identifying and evaluating how they address key barriers associated with
   delivering retrofit at scale, including engaging households, developing
   local supply chains and overcoming economic barriers. The research takes
   a qualitative approach with ten semi-structured interviews to understand
   the perspectives of community practitioners, intermediaries and
   policymakers. Our findings suggest communityled retrofit is effective at
   engaging households, can contribute to local supply chain development,
   help households access financing, and be a valuable delivery partner for
   local authority fuel poverty schemes. However, while community-led
   retrofit offers an alternative approach to retrofit governance, it is
   unlikely to deliver residential retrofit at scale without a broader
   government programme of financial and regulatory support.},

   research and innovation and the definition of the outcomes as the
   expression of human values such as safety, justice, sustainability and
   efficiency. The purpose of this article is to present a reflexion
   regarding to a contextualization of this approach in energy research.
   Therefore, a range of theoretical backgrounds, meaning making processes,
   historical approaches, frameworks and contemporary discourses, have been
   examined. Our aim is to provide a detailed review of existing literature
   related to the key elements of Responsible Research and Innovation. The
   innovative contribution is focused in the vision of these key elements
   applied to energy research, with particular reference to renewables and
   the outline of the many factors influencing the real field
   implementation. Results show the existence of a common ground between
   responsible approaches and many concepts from energy research and social
   sciences frames. Responsibility as understood in the RRI framework was
   found not deliberately represented, although, shifts towards responsible
   approach in social dimension treatment of renewable energy research
   appeared notable.},

Title = {The flexibility gap: Socioeconomic and geographical factors driving
   residential flexibility},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Residential consumers are moving to the center of electricity systems
   and their flexibility is seen as a key resource to integrate renewable
   energy sources and support the grid. However, residential flexibility
   capacities are not homogeneous, as they depend on household appliances,
   comfort patterns, occupancy, and climate conditions. Here, we calculate
   the technical flexibility capacities of 45 consumer types in mainland
   Spain, organised according to income and regional criteria. We show that
   flexibility gaps exist at both regional and socioeconomic (income)
   levels with flexibility differences of up to 10 times more capacity
   between the household groups from the lowest to the highest capacities.
   These geographical and socioeconomic gaps in flexibility can lead to
   distortions in national markets and have the potential to exclude
   citizens from the provision of flexibility services. Our results show in
   quantitative terms that a consumer-centered approach without considering
   correcting measures nor these gaps in drafting energy policies may lead
   to increasing inequality levels in the residential sector. Under an
   economic competitive paradigm, households with lower income levels or
   located in regions with lower flexibility potential may be excluded from
   the provision of flexibility to the detriment of households with larger
   potential, raising justice concerns in a flexibility-based energy
   transition.},

Title = {Political economy of bioenergy transitions in developing countries: A
   case study of Punjab, India},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Occupying an important place in the sustainable development discourse,
   bioenergy was widely touted as the `fuel of the future' at the beginning
   of the 21st century. However, in recent years, many adverse impacts of
   commercial bioenergy projects have come to the forefront. These include
   limited ecological benefits, heightened food insecurity across many
   developing countries as well as exploitation of local residents by
   bioenergy producers. There remains a dearth of empirical evidence
   devoted to investigating bioenergy's potential as a sustainable energy
   alternative in developing countries.
   It is against this background that our paper is aimed at making two
   contributions: one, to' provide a ground level empirical data on
   bioenergy initiatives in the Indian Punjab region and, two, to examine
   the theoretical contribution of eco-socialist perspective to assess the
   sustainability potentials of bioenergy in developing economies. The
   eco-socialist perspective treats environmental degradation as a
   `systemic issue' and considers the power and class structures in
   capitalism as the central explanatory parameters in explaining the
   process of environmental degradation. As a part of the transition from
   capitalism to eco-socialism, the eco-socialists advocate for a
   participatory approach to environmental decision making to ensure that
   ecological justice emerges as the central parameter of sustainable
   development.
   The theoretical framing of the case study research on bioenergy projects
   in the region of Punjab, India was informed by the eco-socialist vision.
   The case study employed a `multiple stakeholder' approach to explore the
   opportunities and contestations surrounding bioenergy projects in
   Punjab. Identifying key flaws as well as the promises of bioenergy in
   Punjab that were investigated, our research revealed that in order to be
   a sustainable energy alternative that meets the objective of ecological
   and social justice, bioenergy policies need to address the needs of
   local communities and be cognizant of the inherent socio-economic
   embeddedness of these initiatives. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of key themes and concepts within
   energy-related Social Sciences and Humanities (energy-SSH) research in
   Europe. It aims to use this overview as an introduction for those
   producing strategies and interventions to advance energy and
   sustainability transitions in practice as well as for newcomers to the
   field of energy-SSH research, such as Science, Technology, Engineering
   and Mathematics (STEM) researchers. This paper builds on four extensive
   literature reviews from the EU Horizon 2020 SHAPE ENERGY project on four
   energy topics derived from the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan (EU
   SET-Plan) priorities: energy efficiency, low-carbon energy supply,
   energy system optimisation and transport decarbonisation. Based on a
   cross-cutting analysis of these four literature reviews, this paper
   discusses the evolution of and recent developments across energy-SSH
   research. It highlights two interrelated stories of scholarly expansion
   concerning the role of people in low-carbon energy transitions,
   illustrated with an example on demand-side management, and points
   towards future energy-SSH research and policy priorities.},

Title = {Designing the mid-transition: A review of medium-term challenges for
   coordinated decarbonization in the United States},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {Decarbonizing the energy system is critical for addressing climate
   change. Given the dominance of fossil fuels in the energy system,
   decarbonization requires rapid and significant industrial transition of
   the energy supply at scale. This includes explicit and coordinated plans
   not only for zero carbon phase-in, but for fossil carbon phase-out. Even
   very rapid decarbonization will likely take decades, leading to a
   medium-term future where the conventional, fossil-based energy system
   coexists with a new, zero-carbon energy system. Each imposes operational
   constraints on the other: what we call the mid-transition. Notably, this
   coexistence means that the new, zero-carbon system will develop under
   fossil carbon system constraints. The mid-transition will therefore
   likely require specific analytical metrics designed to support decision
   making under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Many aspects of
   transition will be felt, and shaped, directly by individuals because of
   our direct interactions with energy systems. Even rare missteps are
   likely to have significant and potentially system design-relevant
   impacts on perception, political support, and implementation.
   Comparisons of the new system to the old system are likely to rest on
   experience of a world less affected by climate change, such that
   concerns about lower reliability, higher costs, and other challenges
   might be perceived as inherent to zero-carbon systems, versus energy
   systems facing consequences of climate change and long-term
   underinvestment. This review assesses and evaluates medium-term
   challenges associated with the mid-transition in the United States,
   emphasizing the need for explicit planning for joint and coordinated
   phase-in and phase-out. This article is categorized under: The Carbon
   Economy and Climate Mitigation > Decarbonizing Energy and/or Reducing

Abstract = {The article provides a widened understanding of the concept of end-user
   flexibility and nuances the traditional individual-oriented approach
   often used in discussions on low carbon transitions. The authors draw on
   75 narratives from of a group of end users that is often considered to
   be in a very flexible stage of life, namely students. They discuss the
   co-production of systems connected to material, structural and social
   factors that extend beyond individual willingness to be a flexible
   energy consumer. The article stresses that flexibility is shaped by
   living conditions, everyday life and social norms in particular ways
   that makes it hard to achieve for students and others living in shared
   households. The authors conclude that political incentives for
   low-carbon transitions typically exclude social groups such as students
   and other vulnerable groups in society, and hence may unintentionally
   create and reinforce what they term `flexibility poverty'.},

Title = {Equitable, effective, and feasible approaches for a prospective fossil
   fuel transition},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Most fossil fuel resources must remain unused to comply with the Paris
   Agreement on Climate Change. Scholars and policymakers debate which
   approaches should be undertaken to Leave Fossil Fuels Underground
   (LFFU). However, existing scholarship has not yet inventoried and
   evaluated the array of approaches to LFFU based on their effectiveness,
   equity, or feasibility. Hence, this review article asks: What lessons
   can we learn from reviewing scholarship on proposed approaches to
   leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU)? We identify 28 unique LFFU
   approaches, of which only 12 are deemed environmentally effective (e.g.,
   fossil fuel extraction taxes, bans and moratoria, and financial swaps);
   eight involve moderate-to-high (non-)monetary costs, and only four are
   deemed entirely just and equitable. Of the 12 environmentally effective
   approaches: only three were deemed cost-effective (regulating financial
   capital for fossil fuel projects, removing existing fossil fuel
   subsidies, and bans \& moratoria); merely four were deemed equitable
   (asset write-offs, retiring existing fossil infrastructure, pursuing
   court cases/litigation, and financial swaps); and all were deemed
   institutionally problematic in terms of their feasibility (six were
   challenging to implement as they threatened the vested interests of
   powerful stakeholder groups). Moreover, the reviewed scholarship draws
   heavily on empirical studies of how these LFFU approaches can be
   optimized in European, North American, and Chinese contexts; fewer
   studies have explored the effectiveness and fairness of LFFU approaches
   in the South and/or in a North-South context. Future research should
   particularly focus on North-South fossil fuel financial flows, which
   have received comparatively little attention. This article is

Abstract = {Rare earths are a critical resource for contemporary societies. Among
   their diverse uses, they are key components of sustainability
   technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles. While rare
   earths can help societies transition away from fossil fuels to renewable
   energy and conserve energy, their extraction, processing, and use
   creates serious environmental and social effects around the world,
   especially in China. We argue that environmental justice and
   intergenerational justice concepts can provide an ethical framework for
   navigating this green energy bargain. We survey the environmental and
   social effects that rare earth production causes and the changing
   geography of production that means these effects are being distributed
   worldwide, both in and beyond China. Finally, we consider several
   strategies that miners, manufacturers, designers, and users can use to
   achieve greater environmental justice and intergenerational justice, now
   and for the future.},

Title = {Creating and Optimizing Employment Opportunities for Women in the Clean
   Energy Sector in Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES},
Abstract = {Women are a minority in the energy sector everywhere in the world-and
   Canada is no exception. Concerns about climate change and fossil fuel
   insecurity have ensured significant interest in Canada in the
   technologies and financing for transitioning to clean energy, but far
   too little attention is being paid to the employment equity implications
   of such a transition. Despite growing awareness that renewables like
   wind, solar, and bioenergy generate a much larger volume of employment
   than fossil fuels, even organizations committed to advocating for social
   justice in debates about environmental sustainability in Canada have
   never specifically mentioned gender inequity. This article identifies
   opportunities and constraints for women's employment in the renewable
   and clean energy sector in Canada. Broad findings from this research
   suggest that women can gain optimal traction from clean energy
   initiatives only if there are wider socially progressive policies in
   place. Since women's ability to take advantage of new energy-related
   employment options is often constrained by social barriers that limit
   their access to certain types of education, training, and employment, it
   is crucial social equity policies go beyond energy sector planning to
   optimize economic opportunities for women. The conversation about gender
   equity in Canada's green economy is currently incipient and tokenistic.
   Raising awareness is therefore urgent and critical.},

Title = {Indigenous environmental defenders and the legacy of Macli-ing Dulag:
   Anti -dam dissent, assassinations, and protests in the making of
   Philippine energyscape},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Globally, Indigenous Peoples' dissent against unjust state and corporate
   incursions in their lands is being suppressed. States and corporations
   use penal laws, anti-terrorist legislation, and emergency powers to
   justify the detention of activists, who are subject to intimidation,
   human rights violations, or, at worst, extrajudicial killings. In 2019,
   the Philippines was named the most murderous country for environmental
   defenders; yet the literature about Indigenous Peoples' dissent in the
   country, where militarization of ancestral domains has been a continuing
   state project, remains scant-in contrast to extensive academic attention
   in other places particularly in the Americas. This paper asks how, when
   and where Philippine Indigenous Peoples' dissent started to expand-what
   narratives of mobilizations did history produce, and how do these
   narratives travel across spacetime. Using multi-methods research and
   focusing on the Philippine Cordillera, where mega-hydropower projects
   have been extensively proposed as a key mode for energy transition, yet
   are widely opposed by uncolonized peoples, this paper describes how
   Macli-ing Dulag's assassination, the Ifugao cultural performances, and
   networked mobilization during the second half of 1970s up to the early
   1980s are becoming relevant in present-day dissent against large-hydro
   projects.},

Title = {The potential for community solar in Connecticut: A geospatial analysis
   of solar canopy siting on parking lots},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {635-644},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Local, state, and national governments across the world have set goals
   of transitioning their energy generation to 100\% renewable sources.
   Connecticut is one example of a sub-national state that has set a target
   for a zerocarbon electric sector by 2040. Government reports released on
   how this statewide renewable energy transition will occur pay
   significant attention to utility-scale solar and rooftop solar, but do
   not mention solar canopies as a priority. Yet, solar canopies provide a
   promising approach to fostering decentralized community solar. This
   study develops a novel methodology for assessing the potential for solar
   canopies on a regional scale. The study uses geospatial approaches to
   assess all large parking lots in the state for the viability of solar
   canopies. By applying this methodology to the research setting of
   Connecticut, the study produces the first estimates of the potential
   electrical generation from solar canopies in any region and analyzes how
   solar canopies can contribute to energy justice. The analysis revealed
   that there are 8,416 sites across the state, capable of producing a
   total of 9,042 GWh of electricity, which is equivalent to 37.0\% of
   current electricity use in Connecticut. The analysis compared findings
   to census tract-level demographic data across the state and investigated
   two case study cities to understand energy justice considerations
   related to solar canopy siting. This study demonstrates that solar
   canopies have significant potential as a component of Connecticut's
   energy portfolio and discusses policies that could foster their
   adoption. Finally, the study lays a foundation for future research on
   solar canopy potential by providing a methodology that is replicable
   across various geographical scales.},

Title = {Rethinking community empowerment in the energy transformation: A
   critical review of the definitions, drivers and outcomes},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Empowering communities to engage with the energy transformation is vital
   to meet climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals.
   Communities have a key role to play in the energy transformation,
   through the uptake of new technologies and changing how they engage with
   energy. However, they remain marginalised limiting the broader benefits
   of meaningful participation such as energy democracy, energy justice and
   energy citizenship, which may be achieved through transformation.
   Addressing this problem requires an understanding of how to facilitate
   empowerment. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this paper synthesises
   the literature on community empowerment for sustainable transformations.
   It outlines a conceptualisation of empowerment through its definition,
   drivers and outcomes. Community empowerment in the energy transformation
   should be about the community's own goals and transformative action.
   This view of empowerment can be enabled through a variety of different
   drivers. Empowerment is identified as a multifaceted concept associated
   with a range of different outcomes such as participation, agency,
   autonomy and power-shift. Whilst the four outcomes identified in this
   review are typically described in isolation; we suggest that they are
   instead a scale wherein each step is a form of empowerment in its own
   right and yet represents an overall trajectory of empowerment.
   Facilitating community empowerment within the energy transformation
   requires a shift in both research and practice.},

Pages = {902-921},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {While the decarbonization of the global economy will bring immense
   benefits in the aggregate and to many individuals, it will also be
   disruptive and costly for some, at least in the short term. As these
   disruptions and costs have become increasingly salient in recent years,
   there has been an explosion of interest in the climate policy community
   about how low-carbon transitions can be implemented justly, equitably,
   and politically smoothly. A key part of what is needed in responding to
   this growing interest is a better understanding of the suite of
   `transitional assistance policies' and strategies that can be deployed,
   alongside or as part of climate change mitigation policies and
   processes. Responding to this need, we survey a wide, multi-disciplinary
   literature to answer the `who', `what' and `how' of transitional
   assistance policy: who is likely to be adversely affected by the
   low-carbon transition, and in what ways? What substantive strategies and
   policy instruments are available to governments to mitigate the burdens
   of low-carbon transitions? And how can governments implement such
   strategies and policies successfully? In the course of answering the
   first two of these questions, we develop a novel typology of
   transitional assistance policies, in which multiple policies are
   parsimoniously classified according to one of four coherent policy
   strategies, and one of five kinds of beneficiaries. In answering the
   third question, we emphasize the importance of certain `state
   capacities' for shaping transition processes and managing vested
   interests. Key policy insights Without transitional assistance policies,
   consumers, workers, businesses, specially-affected communities, and
   states that are highly dependent on emissions-intensive assets stand to
   lose from decarbonization. Transitional assistance policies can be
   narrow (addressing financial losses only) or broad (addressing a wider
   range of losses), and conservative (backward-looking) or adaptive
   (forward-looking). Combining these elements yields four coherent
   transitional assistance strategies: compensation; exemption; structural
   adjustment assistance; and comprehensive adaptive support. Comprehensive
   adaptive support strategies have greatest potential for just, equitable
   and smooth transition outcomes, but are costlier and more complex to
   implement. State capacities to steer complex, long-term transitions are
   therefore a crucial variable in transition success.},

Title = {Access for adaptation? Reviewing the linkages between energy, disasters,

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {10-19},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the years, the energy discourse has tenaciously focused on energy
   transitions to expedite climate mitigation efforts. This has
   inadvertently resulted in little attention to the other important link
   between energy and climate, namely energy access and climate adaptation.
   In particular, the potential role of reliable, affordable and
   sustainable modern energy services in strengthening societies' adaptive
   capacities to address climate disaster events has been ignored across
   both policy and practice. This paper probes these links and argues for a
   critically co-dependent conceptual relationship between energy access,
   rural development, and climate adaptation and disaster management. It
   then explores how, if at all, these links may exist in Odisha, one of
   India's most climate vulnerable states with low socio-economic
   development. The paper concludes that a deep-seated policy reform is
   necessary to bring about a shift in how we a) measure `successful'
   disaster policy, b) understand the role of energy in a disaster context,
   and c) recognise, and seek greater synergies between energy access,
   rural development and climate adaptation objectives.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {This paper develops the notion of energy precarity in order to uncover
   the governance practices and material conditions that drive and
   reproduce the inability of households to secure socially- and
   materially-necessitated levels of energy services in the home. The
   overarching aim is to foreground a geographical approach towards the
   study of domestic energy deprivation, by emphasizing the complex
   socio-spatial and material embeddedness of fuel poverty. The paper
   operationalizes these ideas via a field-based study of a group that has
   received limited attention in research and policy on fuel poverty: young
   adults living in privately rented accommodation. In evoking the
   experiences of such individuals, I employ energy precarity as a means of
   unpacking the spaces where energy deprivation is produced, experienced
   and contested. Among other findings, I highlight that people's fluid
   lifestyles and specific end-use energy demand patterns mean that energy
   deprivation metaphorically and physically overflows the limits of home,
   creating multiple performativities of precarity that have received very
   little attention to date.},

Title = {Why Affordable Clean Energy Is Not Enough. A Capability Perspective on
   the Sustainable Development Goals},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper reflects on criticisms raised in the literature on the UN's
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These have been criticized as
   creating a dichotomy between the environment and human beings that fails
   to address the multiple interconnections between the two. This paper
   focuses on SDG7-{''}affordable and clean energy{''}-and suggests that
   there is in fact a tripartite distinction between the environment, human
   beings and technology underlying the SDGs. This distinction, we argue,
   does not adequately represent the multiple interconnections among the
   various SDGs and hampers their implementation. We contend that the
   formulation of SDG7 produces a circular definition of sustainability, a
   difficulty that is currently resolved at the level of the targets and
   indicators in a way that regards energy technologies primarily as
   artifacts. By contrast, the literature on ethical aspects of energy
   systems largely agrees that energy is a paradigmatic example of a
   sociotechnical system. We contend that, by not considering this
   sociotechnical nature, the SDGs run the risk of implicitly defending a
   certain variant of technological optimism and determinism. We argue that
   this is disadvantageous to the environment, human well-being and
   technological development. In line with recent critical evaluations of
   the SDGs, we argue that these (and other) shortcomings can be addressed
   by better connecting the SDGs to human well-being. Building on recent
   literature that expands the scope of the Capability Approach as an
   alternative measure of well-being so as to include considerations of
   sustainability, we articulate a framework that allows us to elucidate
   this connection and thus to take advantage of synergies between human
   well-being and the environment. On the basis of the Capability Approach,
   we argue that equating sustainable energy with renewable energy-as is
   done in the transition from SDG7's goal to its targets-is indefensible
   because, as part of the overarching energy systems, energy technologies
   cannot be classified as simply right or wrong. Rather, the indicators
   and targets within a framework focused on sustainability need to be
   (more) context sensitive, meaning that, among other things, they may
   vary by country and with the available technology.},

Abstract = {The distributed nature of renewable energy has given rise to new forms
   and scales of energy governance, in particular the emerging role of
   households and community organisations in generating and distributing
   renewable energy. Accompanying this trend has been the emergence of
   intermediary organisations, whose role it is to mediate between these
   actors cf. the market and the state, with the aim to move from local
   experimentation to widespread transformational change. While in recent
   years a significant body of research has emerged that has considered
   intermediary functions, less is known about intermediary spaces. By
   tracing how intermediary spaces are shaped, negotiated, protected, and
   expanded, this article makes three contributions to the literature on
   energy governance and low-carbon intermediaries. First, a focus on the
   relational nature of intermediary spaces challenges the community/state
   binary in energy governance. Second, it highlights the power dynamics
   behind these emergent relational spaces; showing such spaces are not
   neutral, but produced through social relations within and beyond them,
   affecting the functions that intermediaries seek to fulfil. Third, it
   provides an understanding of how the ever-changing nature of
   intermediary spaces can also enable new spaces for action to emerge and
   challenge the status quo.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Sustainable development is an integrated blend of energetic, economic,
   social, environmental, and governmental actors, making it one of the
   most challenging and subjective aims of the United Nations. A
   sustainability project that does not consider any of these parameters
   can generate resistance among different actors of society. In this work,
   we have demonstrated that the traditional definition of sustainability
   encompassing economic development, environmental protection, and social
   justice does not adequately cover large-scale renewable energy projects.
   We have presented an illuminating case study of solar development in the
   Yucatan state of Mexico to show that the traditional three-legged stool
   of sustainable development fails to accommodate local power relations
   and their role in energy decision-making. This point is made through a
   substantive and illuminating ethnography of a solar project in the
   community of San Jose Tipceh, which involves the importance of energy
   democracy and understanding power relations in any assessment of
   sustainable development. These power relations are an important
   component of sustainable development, and all megaprojects, especially
   renewable energy projects, require special attention in the governance
   processes. Through an analysis of an example of implementation of a mega
   solar project, we argue that the methodology through which the power is
   exercised is an exercise of great importance because it leads us to a
   scientific discussion that structures an international reflection on
   sustainability. The case study consists of mixed methods, including
   several techniques to deepen the analysis of sociocultural aspects, and
   tries to present the limits and show the weakness of the sustainability
   perspective in such megaprojects. It is concluded that environmental
   justice as a basic element of the new era of renewable energies is
   limited and can generate social injustices. In the same way, this work
   shows how power is exercised in the implementation of energy projects
   and in the absence of equitable comprehensive governance that does not
   consider the local sociocultural contexts of the communities, resulting
   in the generation of new powers and permanent conflicts. At the end of
   this work, a framework to empower local sociocultural contexts for an
   equitable energy transition is recommended.},

Title = {Post-Subsidy Solar PV Business Models to Tackle Fuel Poverty in
   Multi-Occupancy Social Housing},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {UK Feed-in Tariffs created a vibrant business ecosystem for the
   deployment of decentralised renewable energy technologies while
   constituting a regressive tax and increasing inequality. Business model
   innovation spurred by their withdrawal is providing valuable lessons for
   progressive policy design. Using the case study of solar PV deployment
   on multi-occupancy social housing, this paper reveals policy, business
   and organisational challenges that need to be overcome to address fuel
   poverty and reduce inequality. Suitable `export' and `local' business
   models were identified through a workshop and subsequently evaluated
   through qualitative thematic interview analysis. The `local' model
   compares favourably in terms of production costs and benefits for fuel
   poor tenants but unfavourably in terms of transaction costs. Both models
   are considered equally susceptible to changes in policy. Their success
   hinges upon third party intermediaries, peer-to-peer learning and a
   supportive policy environment. This paper concludes with a policy
   recommendation to ensure that energy justice lies at the heart of the
   UK's transition to net-zero carbon through the fair distribution of
   costs and benefits by including specific provisions to protect
   low-income groups.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},

Volume = {108},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Geographers are increasingly engaging with the driving forces and
   implications of energy poverty-a specific but relatively unknown form of
   material deprivation that emerges at the nexus of sociodemographic
   inequalities and built formations. In this article, we argue that an
   improved understanding of the urban embeddedness of energy poverty can
   provide novel insights into the systemic underpinnings of injustice. We
   thus develop a conceptual framework focusing on the links between the
   sociodemographic and housing vulnerabilities to energy poverty on the
   one hand and wider patterns of urban social inequality on the other.
   This approach is applied to the study of several postcommunist cities in
   eastern and central Europe (ECE), where energy poverty has expanded
   rapidly over the past two decades. Using evidence from extensive
   custom-built neighborhood surveys, we interrogate the sociodemographic,
   housing, and infrastructural features of households that experience a
   lack of adequate domestic energy services. Our results point to the
   existence of distinct landscapes and typologies of energy vulnerability
   in the urban fabric. Material deprivation-a phenomenon that has rarely
   been studied in infrastructural terms-creates new sociospatial
   inequalities that might supplant patterns and processes of intraurban
   differentiation.},

Title = {Energy decentralization in South Africa: Why past failure points to
   future success},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {South Africa's energy transition has stalled on two related fronts: its
   rollout of renewable energy (RE) sources has suffered interruptions and
   delays, proceeding too slowly; and its extension of reliable and
   affordable electricity has been hampered by both irregularities of
   coal-generated supply, as well as austerity-driven delivery policies.
   This paper argues however that the concurrence of two, previously
   sequential historical events - fiscal crisis and intra-regime schism -
   currently augur more auspiciously for a more concerted move toward ED.
   After explaining the logic of tipping points and critical junctures, it
   shows why prior attempts at decentralization failed, how centralised RE
   has disempowered local communities, and why this may change with the
   planned unbundling of the country's energy parastatal, Eskom.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {594-601},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The decarbonisation of the UK economy requires a myriad of policies that
   inherently produce winners and loser across society. This study
   investigates how such distributional impacts are considered in the
   appraisal process for UK energy and climate policies. Using a scorecard
   developed to capture the guidance on policy appraisal and distributional
   analysis, 79 impact assessments were evaluated. The majority of these
   impact assessments either did not or only partially considered the
   impacts of policies on vulnerable groups in society, with only eight
   assessments containing more detailed distributional analysis. Moreover,
   a bias seems to exist as to which areas of energy and climate policy
   provide well-founded analysis and which do not. With further insights
   gained from interviews with relevant actors, this research concludes
   that political motivation, analytical difficulties and a lack of
   awareness of the prevalence and importance of distributional impacts are
   at the root of this insufficient consideration. Possible alterations to
   the current IA framework are presented, which aim to more firmly embed
   the distributional impact assessment in the appraisal process.},

Title = {Justice, social exclusion and indigenous opposition: A case study of
   wind energy development on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec is one of the windiest places on
   Earth and the scene of a large-scale wind energy development plan
   conceived by the Mexican government in conjunction with multinational
   companies. We analyze the national wind energy development policy, and
   the negotiation processes, alliances and popular local indigenous
   resistance created by what is known as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Wind
   Energy Megaproject. We observe how the Mexican government, in its
   eagerness to grant control of regional wind energy resources to private
   sector companies, generated social schisms and conflicts in regional
   indigenous communities. These arose largely due to the absence of land
   use planning rules and conflict resolution mechanisms of the property
   rights issued for communal and social control, heritage of the Mexican
   revolution in the 1910's. We describe recent government initiatives
   implemented in response to this dynamic and aimed at reviving
   construction of a wind farm previously blocked by popular indigenous
   protests. This unsuccessful attempt exposed a lack of institutional
   interest in guaranteeing local involvement in project planning and in
   correcting existing top-down political and operation practices. Wind
   energy development in Mexico resembles an extractive model, with no
   consideration of local cultures or organizations, or the potential for
   joint ventures with local stakeholders that would treat rural indigenous
   populations as assets in the national energy transition, begun in 2007
   for wind private projects in the region.},

Title = {Conflicted by conservatism? Exploring authoritarian values, climate
   politics, and alternative energy funding public opinion in the United
   States},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Academic assessments typically conclude that right-wing authoritarian
   populism poses a significant political challenge to the advancement of
   climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Right-wing
   recalcitrance and hostility to climate change policy have been
   attributed to the authoritarian personality, rejection of science,
   skeptical views of government elites and corporations, and even some
   forms of psychological distress. Employing public opinion data collected
   in the U.S. during the first term of the Trump Presidency, our work
   confirms that persons who score high on populism, authoritarianism,
   anti-science indices, and those who hold ideologically conservative
   views tend to oppose increased public investment in alternative energy.
   Not explored in the environmental policy and alternative energy
   literature is the conflicted (or compassionate) conservative; the
   individual who espouses conservative values yet supports social
   justice-promotive public policies. As an addition to current theoretical
   and empirical understanding, we find that conflicted conservatives,
   individuals who identify as politically conservative yet favor social
   justice expenditures, are significantly more supportive of enhanced
   public investment in alternative energy.},

Title = {Sacrificing the local to support the national: Politics, sustainability,
   and governance in Nepal's hydropower paradox},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Developing run-of-the-river (ROR) hydropower can pose a sustainability
   paradox. The paradox can occur when countries prioritize hydropower
   development to achieve national-level sustainable development targets
   while failing to include project-affected communities in planning
   processes. This research developed a comparative study examining the
   ways social and political relations were articulated between hydropower
   companies and project-affected communities across 12 ROR hydropower
   sites in the Gandaki River basin of Nepal. The study details how the
   introduction of hydropower can feasibly offer local communities coveted
   benefits such as increased water and electricity access and
   availability. Outcomes of ROR hydropower development, however, were not
   uniform across study sites and spatially uneven development was
   manifest. Consequently, many of Nepal's ROR hydropower projects
   exacerbate social and political inequalities in Nepal's mountain river
   basins, which in turn fuel hydropower driven conflicts. Drawing on
   theories of global change, energy justice, and political ecology, this
   research highlights opportunities currently being neglected in Nepal to
   bring local communities into processes linked to national sustainable
   development goals and targets and to address injustices embedded in the
   development of ROR hydropower resources.},

Title = {A values-based approach to energy controversies: Value-sensitive design
   applied to the Groningen gas controversy in the Netherlands},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {639-648},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many energy cases suffer from social opposition. It is increasingly
   asserted that paying due attention to the moral values involved in
   controversial energy cases may increase social acceptance.
   Value-sensitive design (VSD) has been recommended as a promising
   approach for addressing moral values in controversial energy cases. This
   paper aims to empirically explore the applicability of VSD in
   controversial energy cases by investigating the extent to which it is
   possible to identify the relevant values, norms and design requirements
   in the Groningen gas controversy (the Netherlands) using values
   hierarchies. It was found in this case that the relevant values, norms
   and design requirements could be retrieved, but that two conditions need
   to be fulfilled to avoid underexposure of relevant values. Firstly, data
   should be collected using a variety of data sources. Secondly, these
   sources should be analyzed through both top-down approaches and
   bottom-up approaches. We find that `Safety' is a critical value in the
   Groningen case, while other critical values are related to securing
   `Procedural Justice'. Strikingly, the important procedural values
   `Trust' and `Honesty' did not translate into concrete policies. Policy
   makers can use values hierarchies to address moral values in energy
   cases and to translate these values into concrete measures.},

Title = {Sociotechnical agendas: Reviewing future directions for energy and
   climate research},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The field of science and technology studies (STS) has introduced and
   developed a ``sociotechnical{''} perspective that has been taken up by
   many disciplines and areas of inquiry. The aims and objectives of this
   study are threefold: to interrogate which sociotechnical concepts or
   tools from STS are useful at better understanding energy-related social
   science, to reflect on prominent themes and topics within those
   approaches, and to identify current research gaps and directions for the
   future. To do so, the study builds on a companion project, a systematic
   analysis of 262 articles published from 2009 to mid-2019 that
   categorized and reviewed sociotechnical perspectives in energy social
   science. It identifies future research directions by employing the
   method of ``co creation{''} based on the reflections of sixteen
   prominent researchers in the field in late 2019 and early 2020. Drawing
   from this co-created synthesis, this study first identifies three main
   areas of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research (sociotechnical
   systems, policy, and expertise and publics) with 15 topics and 39
   subareas. The study then identifies five main themes for the future
   development of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research:
   conditions of systematic change; embedded agency; justice, power,
   identity and politics; imaginaries and discourses; and public engagement
   and governance. It also points to the recognized need for pluralism and
   parallax: for research to show greater attention to demographic and
   geographical diversity; to stronger research designs; to greater
   theoretical triangulation; and to more transdisciplinary approaches.},

Abstract = {The success of Australia's energy transition is dependent on households'

   trust, privacy and collectivism affect participants' motivation to
   curtail energy use, share control of solar/battery assets and share
   energy data, yet motivation does not guarantee ability to participate.
   The paper contributes and operationalises a provisional method for
   scoring Motivation, Ability in the MOA framework, toward better
   understanding customers' potential use or participation in future energy
   technologies and interactions. This quantification overcomes limitations
   of existing scoring systems which do not adequately account for negative
   (rather than simply low) motivation. Findings suggest that increasing
   users' ability with emergent technologies requires first increasing
   familiarity and further avenues for more involved consumer participation
   in the design of energy futures.},

Title = {Building Energy Commons: Three Mini-PV Installation Cases in Apartment
   Complexes in Seoul},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Solar photovoltaics (PV) deployment is not easy in dense urban areas
   because there is little space for the installation. Furthermore, tenants
   have few incentives to install PV panels because they frequently
   relocate, and most PV facilities are nonremovable. To address these
   factors, this study reports on an innovative model that collectively
   installed 260 W of mini-PV on the balconies of almost all the households
   in two high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul, South Korea. This project
   was unique in that it established energy commons in a community using
   private space. This study found that economic and social factors
   significantly influenced community-internal or micro factors, which in
   turn affected the success of the community energy project. Economic
   factors such as the expected economic benefit and residents paying no
   direct installation costs shaped the initial conditions for the
   commencement of the project. Leadership played a key role by speeding up
   the process, relieving residents' concerns and distrust. This study
   introduced an innovative community energy model that can be referenced
   by megacities and communities. It provides opportunities for enhancing
   awareness of energy transition via on-site energy production using
   renewable energy and allows even communities that have insufficient
   common space to build energy commons.},

Title = {Will Plans to Ease Energy Poverty Go Up in Smoke? Assessing the
   Hungarian NECP through the Lens of Solid Fuel Users' Vulnerabilities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hungary has one of the highest incidences of energy poverty in the
   European Union, and a high share of Hungarian low-income households rely
   on solid fuels. This paper first maps the energy vulnerabilities of
   Hungarian solid fuel users using six energy vulnerability factors. The
   mapping underlines that solid fuel users are more exposed to energy
   vulnerability than average households. This is followed by an analysis
   of energy-poverty-related objectives and measures outlined in the
   Hungarian National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a key policy document
   of the green energy transition. The paper outlines that the NECP fails
   to comply with the requirement of setting energy poverty alleviation
   objectives. Furthermore, the outlined energy-poverty-related policies
   and measures fail to provide systematic solutions to energy-poverty
   drivers, especially those solid fuel users' vulnerabilities. Hungary's
   general antiegalitarian policy environment and the weak design of energy
   poverty measures in the NECP suggest severe deficiency regarding a just
   energy transition guarantee. A just energy transition in Hungary is
   therefore endangered by the fact that EU energy poverty alleviation
   requirements fall under soft-law coordination mechanisms that make such
   requirements hardly enforceable in a member state with an antipoor
   policy bias that is reluctant to tackle energy poverty.},

Title = {Lithium in International Law: Trade, Investment, and the Pursuit of
   Supply Chain Justice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-170},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Projected demand for renewable energy storage has underlined the
   importance of lithium-ion batteries, reflected in concern over `supply
   chain security' for critical minerals. Yet, other voices have called for
   `supply chain justice' among governments, firms, and communities
   affected by the social and environmental externalities of lithium
   extraction. To anticipate disputes and draw a baseline for further
   research, this article surveys the relevant rules of international law
   that presently regulate major operations of the lithium industry. First,
   the material dimensions of lithium are transformed into a workable
   object of international law, focusing on viable reserves (as opposed to
   all proven resources) and the analytical priority of territorial
   jurisdiction. Second, the regulatory regimes of four States with major
   reserves-Chile, Australia, Argentina, and China-illustrate recurring
   challenges, such as incentivizing investment in value-added production
   and the discontent of Indigenous communities. Third, the trade and
   investment treaties of these States help us to map an international
   legal framework for the lithium industry, focusing on the World Trade
   Organization, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
   Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic
   Partnership. But such treaties may be interpreted in light of a State's
   obligations concerning human rights, environmental protection, and
   Indigenous peoples, giving legal form to the pursuit of supply chain
   justice in the energy transition.},

Title = {What are the social outcomes of climate policies? A systematic map and
   review of the ex-post literature},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It is critical to ensure climate and energy policies are just, equitable
   and beneficial for communities, both to sustain public support for
   decarbonisation and address multifaceted societal challenges. Our
   objective in this article is to examine the diverse social outcomes that
   have resulted from climate policies, in varying contexts worldwide, over
   the past few decades. We review 203 ex-post climate policy assessments
   that analyse social outcomes in the literature. We systematically and
   comprehensively map out this work, identifying articles on carbon,
   energy and transport taxes, feed-in-tariffs, subsidies, direct
   procurement policies, large renewable deployment projects, and other
   regulatory and market-based interventions. We code each article in terms
   of their studied social outcomes and effects, with a focus on
   electricity access, energy affordability, community cohesion,
   employment, distributional and equity issues, livelihoods and poverty,
   procedural justice, subjective well-being and drudgery. Our analysis
   finds that climate and energy policies often fall short of delivering
   positive social outcomes. Nonetheless, across country contexts and
   policy types there are manifold examples of climate policymaking that
   does deliver on both social and climate goals. This requires attending
   to distributive and procedural justice in policy design, and making use
   of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that policy costs and benefits are
   fairly shared. We emphasize the need to further advance ex-post policy
   assessments and learn about what policies work for a just transition.},

   Mapuche-Williche Territory, Chile},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {269-282},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this article, I examine how hydropower projects in Mapuche territory
   both form part of internationally recognized approaches to develop
   renewable energy and also anchor colonial relations in rivers. In
   pursuit of energy development, water and ancestral cultural practices of
   the Mapuche Pueblo are being seized by a nexus of state laws and
   informal practices of private sector actors. Concurrently, Mapuche
   people assert their jurisdictions and experience resurgence of
   Indigenous lifeways through defending their waterways. Drawing on
   collaborative research guided by the Alianza Territorial Puelwillimapu,
   a Mapuche-Williche alliance convoked by ancestral leaders, I provide a
   methodological contribution to legal geography's analysis of Indigenous
   rights. Bringing a legal geography approach to dispossession, I explain
   how collaborative mapmaking and systematizing the ``layers of
   dispossession{''} provides a methodological approach to consider
   structural limitations to environmental justice on Indigenous lands.
   Overall, this case contributes to how we conceive of spatial justice in
   legal geography and in renewable energy development.},

Title = {Autonomous mobility justice in the situated Finnish context: A
   Foucauldian perspective on technology, power, and morality},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arguably the most powerful artifact of the 20th century, the private car
   brought profound spatial, social, and cultural changes, as well as
   wide-ranging mobility justice implications. Autonomous mobility
   technologies, with the power to supplant part or all of the action of
   the driver by collecting and processing large quantities of fine grained
   data, promise to shift power away from users to engineers and create new
   important spatial and social implications for mobility justice, of which
   little are known. This research draws from Foucauldian
   conceptualizations adapted for the study of geographies of power to
   investigate how autonomous mobility technology may diagram spatial
   rationalities and moralities into the built environment. To that effect,
   it draws from 30 interviews of intermediaries in Finland-a country
   actively pursuing a transition to automated and shared mobility as part
   of an ICT-driven innovation policy. Examining autonomous mobility
   through a Foucauldian lens helps highlight the complex power relations
   it affords-in terms of changes in social structure and infrastructure,
   and social justice. By shedding light on how technology may structure
   the built environment, the Foucauldian perspective shows itself to be a
   valuable tool for planning and policymaking, providing insight into how
   autonomous mobility (in)justice may be assembled.},

Abstract = {In this article we undertake a systematic mapping of 649 cases of
   resistance movements to both fossil fuel (FF) and low carbon energy
   (LCE) projects, providing the most comprehensive overview of such
   place-based energy-related mobilizations to date. We find that (1)
   Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both
   fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects
   encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or
   delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy
   and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both
   disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities
   and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to
   have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and
   environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters
   and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10\% of all
   cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was
   particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and
   coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least
   conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects.
   The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means
   inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that
   conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through
   which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its
   impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic
   participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism,
   climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate
   and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and
   preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative
   pathways to decarbonization.},

Abstract = {Falling real incomes, rising utility prices and the historically poor
   thermal quality of the housing stock are some of the main factors that
   have driven the rise of systemic injustices surrounding energy poverty
   in the post-communist states of Eastern and Central Europe (ECE). We
   undertake a socio-spatial and temporal assessment of energy poverty in
   Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, using Household Budget Survey
   micro-data and the consolidated national results of the EU Survey of
   Income and Living Conditions. Our results indicate that increases in
   domestic energy prices and expenditures during the last decade have not
   been offset by purchasing power gains or energy efficiency improvements,
   resulting in sustained and growing levels of energy poverty. Capital
   city regions have fared better than rural areas even if traditional
   macroeconomic performance indicators do not easily match domestic energy
   deprivation metrics. We thus question policy approaches that favour
   income-based solutions and fail to recognise housing-and
   demography-related vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Energy is essential to the provision of humanitarian aid, from operating
   medical and non-medical equipment, to storing vaccines and drugs. In the
   last decades, the contexts of intervention of humanitarian actors are
   getting more complex and volatile, sometimes leading to longer project
   lifespans. To respond to this evolving context, and at the same time to
   try to cope with the global ecological crisis, humanitarian actors are
   proposing new strategies toward more sustainable energy solutions in
   their operations. However, there is a lack of reflection regarding how
   energy is conceived and used in the humanitarian response. With the aim
   of shedding light on these issues, we take the case of Medecins Sans
   Frontieres, a medical humanitarian organization who is rethinking its
   traditional logics of energy planning. The results reveal that even if
   some transformative approaches to energy are emerging in the
   humanitarian field, they face several challenges when putting them into
   practice. Challenges related to effectiveness and flexibility, core
   concerns of the humanitarian aid. The work invites to a deeper look at
   the plurality of those challenges, aiming to gain better understanding
   on the relationship between energy and society and its operational
   impact.},

Title = {Changing the policy paradigm: A benefit maximization approach to
   electricity planning in developing countries},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {264},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Access to electricity can lead to enhanced education, business, and
   healthcare opportunities. Governments in emerging economies are often
   faced with the challenge of increasing access to electricity and
   reducing system inequality, while operating under severe budget
   constraints. This paper develops a methodology for finding the optimal
   expansion of a power system under the objective of maximizing social
   benefit, as it relates to distributional equality for electricity
   access, subject to a budget constraint. This contrasts with traditional
   models, which minimize the cost of satisfying projected electricity
   demand. We formulate a generation expansion planning problem as a
   utility-maximization mixed-integer linear program and apply it to a case
   study analysis of a low-income country with limited electricity
   infrastructure. We focus our analysis on understanding how the optimal
   allocation of generation between centralized and distributed resources
   is impacted by stakeholder preferences toward equality and different
   budget levels. We find that a high preference for equality leads to
   lower overall electricity consumption levels, but improved
   electrification rates due to greater investment (300-750 km increase) in
   transmission infrastructure. If stakeholders move from a low to a high
   equality preference then they could see a 72-87\% increase in energy
   access equality rating depending on the budget. Conversely, indifference
   to equality leads to higher overall consumption levels in urban areas
   but reduced electrification rates. This methodology can help decision
   makers evaluate the social trade-offs between improving energy access,
   reducing energy inequality and poverty, and increasing total electricity
   consumption when operating under budget constraints in their countries.},

Title = {Participatory network mapping of an emergent social network for a
   regional transition to a low-carbon and just society on the Dingle
   Peninsula},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Abstract = {The paper develops a methodological approach that acts as a tool for
   active change agents working in community and just transition contexts
   to increase their capacity to engage a wider public in planning. An
   innovative contribution is made to the literature through the
   development of a participatory action research (PAR) based approach to
   social network analysis using a participatory mapping method with
   relation to sustainable transitions. The method comprises a
   participatory network mapping approach, adapted from the Net-Map
   toolkit, which is applied to a multi-stakeholder approach to realising a
   regional sustainability transition in the Republic of Ireland. Dingle
   Peninsula 2030 is an initiative aiming to transition a geographic region
   in the South West of Ireland to a low-carbon society by 2030 across the
   sectors of energy, agriculture, transport, education, employment, marine
   and tourism. Due to the scope of the overall project, a diverse range of
   stakeholders are involved. The method developed is used to undertake a
   qualitative collaborative social network analysis. The paper focuses on
   method, by analysing and reflecting upon the use of this participatory
   approach, in the initial stages of the overall project, in addressing
   complex sustainability and just transition challenges as they are
   revealed through a multi-stakeholder approach. Within this, the themes
   of participatory justice, social learning and visualising complexity are
   explored; and benefits and future improvements are outlined through
   reflections from both the researcher and the participant community.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The notion of place is quite useful to account for local acceptance of
   energy transitions. Using semi-structured interviews and content
   analysis, this article explores how new places are imagined or formed in
   opposition to wind farms in South Korea, with a focus on the memory of
   place disruption and sensory interactions with wind turbines. First,
   residents opposed to the construction of wind farms imagine negative
   places in opposition to future energy transitions, such as places in
   which landslides and ecological disruptions have occurred, based on
   trauma from past place disruption. Second, residents' sensory
   experiences of the noise created by wind turbines and the turbines'
   aviation-obstruction lights form concepts of artificial, urban, or
   mechanical places in opposition to the natural or rural quality of the
   places prior to wind turbine construction. These negative places that
   are formed based on memory and sensory input drive opposition to wind
   turbines. Therefore, place-people relations should be adequately and
   carefully discussed in both site-planning and community engagement
   processes associated with wind farms.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper explores challenges and possibilities for integrating goals
   of long-term sustainable development into urban planning practice, with
   a specific focus on local institutional conditions for sustainability
   transitions. The analysis is based on a qualitative single case study of
   a large urban development process: the development of a new city
   district in Hyllie in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Hyllie was branded as a
   flagship project for sustainable urban development, with particularly
   high ambitions on climate neutrality and sustainable energy consumption.
   Several innovative elements were initiated in the development process,
   for instance the ``climate contract{''} between the municipality and
   large energy companies. In the paper, this climate contract is discussed
   as an initiative with a promising potential for sustainability
   transitions. In practice, however, the outcome of the development in
   Hyllie in terms of sustainable development is ambiguous, since the
   district is also framed around luxury shopping, entertainment, and an
   ambition to attract visitors from a long distance. The Hyllie
   development illustrates pre-requisites for work on sustainable
   development in a decentralized and market-oriented planning context.
   Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by the multi-level perspective
   (MLP) and institutional theory. The results illustrate how the
   development process was shaped by a complex interplay between actors
   with differing agendas and targets at different stages in the process.
   These results are applied in a general discussion of challenges and
   possibilities for urban planning to contribute substantially to a
   transition to long-term sustainable development. Overall, the analysis
   demonstrates the importance of considering specific local institutional
   conditions in strategic work for long-term sustainability.},

Title = {The micropolitical life of energy projects: A collaborative exploration
   of injustice and resistance to small hydropower projects in the
   Wallmapu, Southern Chile},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article contributes to an emerging body of literature about the
   micropolitics of the transition to renewable energy by examining how
   community leaders, in order to protect their territories, contest the
   energy transition. We present findings from two ethnographic case
   studies of small hydropower plants (SHPs) in indigenous Mapuche
   territory. As SHPs up to 20 MW are considered renewable projects by law,
   Chilean national authorities consider them as a non-invasive
   eco-friendly solution and, consequently, most of these projects are
   approved without carrying out an indigenous consultation and, thus,
   ignoring community leaders' demands for territorial autonomy. Following
   a micropolitical ecology approach, this paper analyses community
   leaders' resistance towards SHPs in Mapuche territories by discussing
   three key aspects: 1) access to information, 2) participation in
   decision-making processes, and 3) changes in community politics. These
   are different dimensions of the `micropolitical life of SHPs', a
   heuristic tool, defined in collaboration with community leaders to
   explore the contentious political dynamics that community leaders
   experience in their resistance against SHPs on the one hand, and to
   describe how community leaders' political practices shape and are shaped
   by contingent encounters and alliances in specific historical and
   territorial settings on the other. We conclude that despite the anguish
   that SHPs cause, community leaders bring about hope that may create
   possibilities to transform their territories.},

Title = {How to make building renovation work for low-income renters: Preferences
   for distributional principles and procedural options in Austria},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Widespread thermal refurbishment of existing buildings is essential for
   mitigating carbon emissions and energy poverty. Retrofitting for better
   energy efficiency in low-income rental housing comes up against the
   tenant-landlord dilemma, however; for renovation to be accepted by
   residents, rules for cost sharing and fair implementation are required.
   The present study employs structural equation modelling to analyse
   distributional and procedural preferences in a survey sample of 942
   social welfare recipients in Austria. The distributional principles of
   polluter-pays and energy bill neutrality are preferred for allocating
   renovation costs. Equal-pay, ability-to-pay, and paying extra
   instalments to finance the renovation are only accepted for buildings in
   high need of renovation. Low-income renters welcome a wide range of
   procedural options, in particular, providing transparent and
   comprehensive information on the planned renovation and mitigating
   inconvenience during the construction phase. Psychological and
   relational capabilities play into these preferences: households holding
   proenvironmental attitudes favour polluter-pays to prevent free-riders.
   A frugal mindset, trust in the landlord and renter concerns make
   low-income renters endorse ability-to-pay to avoid being displaced to
   lower-grade dwellings on a discriminating housing market. The results
   suggest that distributional principles need not stand alone but could be
   combined. For instance, allocating the majority of renovation costs by
   polluter-pays, but a smaller share by ability-to-pay, may cushion
   disproportionate impacts on less affluent residents. Energy counselling
   could empower low-income renters to manage personal energy and
   renovation costs, and to build literacy about renovation benefits and
   legal claims to encourage their landlord to renovate.},

Abstract = {A normative analysis of the problem of optimal extraction of a
   nonrenewable resource is considered. The economy depends on the
   essential nonrenewable resource and the rate of the resource extraction
   is increasing over time. At some point the government gradually switches
   to a sustainable (in sense of non-decreasing consumption over time)
   pattern of the resource extraction. Different approaches are offered for
   the construction of the paths of switching to decreasing resource use.
   Some seemingly attractive short-run policies of switching to decreasing
   extraction can run counter to long-run criteria. If we consider the
   maximin principle, applied to the negative shock on the output percent
   change, as the short-run criterion, then the optimal transition path can
   be consistent with the long-run government goals. It is shown
   analytically and numerically that there are values of parameters for the
   transition paths of extraction that consumption along these paths is
   asymptotically constant or infinitely growing. A new approach to the
   Rawlsian maximin criterion which allows for growth of consumption is
   offered. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The energy sector provides fuel for much of everyday life, particularly
   economically and socially. Fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, a
   well-functioning and resilient energy sector is vital for maintaining
   the operation of critical infrastructures, including, most importantly,
   the health sector, and timely economic recovery. Notwithstanding its
   importance in everyday life and crises, the energy sector itself is
   currently in a complex and far-reaching transformation to combat climate
   change whilst supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and
   society, mainly through the development of variable renewable energy
   sources (RES) such as wind and solar photovoltaics. This paper
   highlights the need for energy resilience as countries face the triple
   challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis, the consequent economic crisis,
   and the climate crisis. Focusing on Europe, it is advanced here that
   with the ability to balance fluctuating electricity generation and
   demand, flexibility allows the energy sector to utilise low-carbon RES
   reliably, ensuring a more resilient and sustainable energy future. This
   paper derives five urgent policy recommendations for Europe that address
   possible impacts of COVID-19 on the economic and societal prerequisites
   for flexibility in energy systems.},

Title = {Why Ghana will not achieve its renewable energy target for electricity.
   Policy, legal and regulatory implications},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {75-83},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Republic of Ghana aims to develop and utilise renewable energy and
   energy efficiency technologies to achieve a 10\% penetration of national
   electricity production by 2020. The government also aims to achieve a
   100\% national electrification with renewable energy identified as the
   catalyst for achieving this policy goal. The situation however is, as of
   December 2017, Ghana has been able to achieve a 0.5\% penetration rate
   of electricity from renewable energy sources in its total generation
   mix. This paper argues that Ghana is unable to reach its renewable
   energy target of 10\% by 2020 given that it needs to integrate 9.5\% of
   renewables from 2018 to 2020 whiles it has only been able to achieve
   0.5\% penetration rate since 2006. Legal and regulatory issues such as
   lack of legislative instruments by regulatory agencies incumbent upon
   achieving the renewable energy policy target, lack of independence of
   institution structure and the lack of regulatory assessment are some of
   the key reasons behind this argument. The implication of these issues is
   that, investors lose confidence in the government's ability to maintain
   and achieve both current and future renewable energy policy goals.
   Investors become uncertain and this leads to underinvestment in
   renewable projects and subsequently, failure in achieving renewable
   energy targets.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {This article analyses the latest chapter in the saga of renewable energy
   support schemes, namely Essent Belgium (C-492/14), which was handed down
   by the European Court of Justice at the end of September 2016. It
   assesses the judgment in the light of preceding judgments such as Alands
   Vindkraft and Essent Belgium (in which the claimant was the same company
   as in the present case) delivered in 2014, which dealt with the
   conformity of renewable energy support schemes with free movement of
   goods. As is well known, the Court's case law on this topic has been-as
   emphasised by AG Bot-rather confusing, to say the least. Therefore, this
   case note examines whether the recently delivered judgment clarifies the
   current state of play in any respect. The answer seems to be that it
   comes down to the principle of proportionality and in particular to the
   design of the support schemes. In addition to discussing the judgment,
   the article provides some reflections on the so-called ``Winter
   Package{''} proposals on renewable energy.},

Title = {Warming with wood: Exploring the everyday heating practices of rural
   off-gas households in Wales},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {142},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rural off-gas households, the highest carbon emitters in the UK, have
   largely been overlooked in energy scholarship and policy, resulting in
   limited understanding of the ways in which the socio-material
   inequalities shape their likelihood of moving into fuel poverty. This
   paper sets out to fill this knowledge gap by developing a better
   understanding of the role that non-standard heating technologies play in
   the thermal comfort practices of rural off-gas households in Wales.
   Specifically, this paper focuses on `traditional' wood or biomass
   heating - open fires, enclosed stoves and range-ovens - that are popular
   and commonplace throughout the UK, particularly in rural households,
   where they may be utilised for primary or supplementary heating.
   Findings show that traditional wood/biomass heating, as part of a rural
   off-grid heating-mix, enables households to respond to financial
   tensions in meaningful ways that are perceived to make their
   circumstances better. Additionally, insights highlight the importance of
   considering the potential conflicts between sustainability agendas that
   inform contemporary energy policymaking, as well as understanding the
   existing dynamics of rural off-gas thermal comfort for informing just
   low-carbon transitions.},

Title = {All for sun, sun for all: Can community energy help to overcome
   socioeconomic inequalities in low-carbon technology subsidies?},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {157},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Can community energy help to overcome inequalities in who benefits from
   low-carbon technologies? Research has shown that the distribution of
   low-carbon technology subsidies and their associated benefits can be
   highly uneven across socioeconomic groups, revealing a persistent
   inequality issue. Yet this research has tended to focus almost
   exclusively on adoption of technologies at the household-level, with
   limited insights into whether and how this distribution might differ in
   the case of community energy. To address this, this paper quantitatively
   investigates the distribution of payments to household-and
   community-level energy systems across socioeconomic groups in Scotland
   under the UK government feed-in-tariff. Analysis is conducted on a novel
   dataset of 26,218 household and community wind and solar installations
   across 6,976 micro-level data-zones using a combination of
   distributional analysis and random effects within-between regression. It
   finds that feed-in-tariff payments for household-level wind and solar PV
   systems have heavily benefitted more affluent socioeconomic groups,
   while payments to community energy projects have flowed more
   consistently into areas of higher deprivation, particularly in the case
   of community solar. These findings suggest that community energy has
   been successful in bringing the benefits of low-carbon technologies to
   areas of lower income and higher deprivation, with important lessons for
   policymakers concerned with a just transition going forward.},

Title = {Visualizing Energy Participation: A Method for Practitioners and
   Researchers},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Through our analysis of the data generated by 12 communities in the
   Georgetown University Energy Prize-a US-wide effort to increase energy
   efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions-we present a widely
   useable method to create visual maps of participation in energy
   projects. These maps, which show the breadth (who participated), depth
   (how), and objects (issue) of participation, can summarize large amounts
   of information on participation in just a few visualizations. For this
   study, these maps describe how communities organized to decrease the
   consumption of gas and electricity at the municipal and residential
   levels during the prize. Our results show that broader and deeper
   participation would not always lead to greater energy savings. Thus,
   instead of blindly aiming for higher participation to achieve better
   outcomes, results suggest that breadth, depth and objects of
   participation must be strategized based on the context and possibilities
   of the community, as well as the goals of the project. Maps do not only
   add transparency in decision-making processes by disclosing the who, how
   and on what of participation, but also facilitate the comparison of
   participatory efforts across process, communities and time. While the
   maps visualized participation that occurred in the past, the framework
   and method can be customized and used by governments, planners,
   community stakeholders, etc. in understanding, mapping and strategizing
   ongoing future participatory efforts in energy projects. Our instrument
   offers a flexible framework to plan, implement, evaluate, and research
   participatory interventions past, present and future.},

Abstract = {This paper advances a households-in-place perspective to understanding
   socio-spatial disadvantage in energy-carbon restructuring. This reflects
   evidence that the costs and benefits of low carbon restructuring will
   not be distributed evenly or fairly between people and places. Some
   households and localities will benefit from decarbonization but others
   will be disproportionately affected by rising energy costs and job loss.
   In this paper we use the example of England to explore different
   dimensions of advantage and disadvantage in low carbon restructuring and
   how they might be reinforced or mediated by intervention by governments,
   NGOs and citizens. The paper makes a distinctive contribution by linking
   different sites and policy areas in the distributional politics of
   decarbonization from the perspective of individuals and households.
   Emphasis is placed on understanding just energy-carbon transitions from
   a households-in-place perspective. The analytical framework is
   exemplified through case studies of the coming to ground of different
   strands of energy-carbon restructuring in England.},

Title = {Thinking, doing, organising: Prefiguring just and sustainable energy
   systems via collective prosumer ecosystems in Europe},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article positions collective renewable energy prosumerism as a
   social movement that engages in energy system transformation. Collective
   renewable energy prosumer initiatives engage in `prefigurative' work
   through their discursive framings (ways of thinking), their activities
   (ways of doing) and their understanding and enactment of social
   relations (ways of organising). The core of this article is a
   comparative analysis of the prefigurative work of 13 collective
   prosumers from 7 European countries (Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Italy,
   Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom). The article discusses their
   contributions to energy system transformation, including renewable
   energy production, different mechanisms for involving citizens, local
   value creation, and the degree of desired and actual collaboration and
   networking within broader prosumer ecosystems. We then discuss these
   contributions against societal discourses and expectations towards
   prosumerism, such as energy democracy, energy justice, and environmental
   sustainability and decarbonisation. This reveals three tensions: 1) a
   focus on decarbonisation but not on broader environmental problems, 2)
   the involvement of certain people and not of others, and 3) the building
   of prosumer eco-systems while ignoring incumbency. Future research
   avenues are formulated to conclude the article.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the tax incentives and aids adopted in the taxes and
   environmental policies to improve the energy efficiency of Spanish
   households. The established environmental policy presents advances
   although with incipient results, since the energy efficiency of the
   houses still plays a secondary role. In the area of taxes, no tax
   incentives have been effective in reducing the investment in
   improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, especially in those of
   old construction. Our conclusions indicate the convenience of promoting
   the energy efficiency of homes through the fiscal route. In this sense,
   it proposes incorporating an incentive to the Personal Income Tax linked
   to improved energy rating of housing. Also, it raises the improvements
   in the current regulations on tax benefits on the Real Estate Tax and on
   the Tax on Building, Installations and Infrastructural Work. These are
   two of the main features of this paper.},

Title = {Green New Deal proposals: Comparing emerging transformational climate
   policies at multiple scales},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Green New Deal (GND) policy proposals that simultaneously address the
   climate crisis and economic inequity by prioritizing job creation have
   been developed for multiple different levels of government in
   jurisdictions around the world. The United States federal GND originally
   introduced to Congress by Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator
   Markey in 2019 has received the most attention. Since then, however,
   multiple other climate policy proposals that share the GND's integrated
   multi-sectoral approach have emerged. To date, there has been minimal
   comparative assessment of these different proposals that build from a
   GND framework. As cities, regions, and countries around the world plan
   recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to worsening economic
   inequities, racial injustices, and climate disruptions, the need to
   study policies that simultaneously address environmental, economic, and
   social issues with an integrated approach is stronger than ever. This
   paper reviews 14 GND-style policy proposals across multiple levels of
   government, from municipal to multi-national, comparing their structure,
   level of detail, and goals. We find that GND frameworks are emerging as
   a new, multifaceted policy approach to confront the complex, multiple
   drivers of climate change with greater scope than traditional
   market-based and behavior-based strategies.},

Title = {Tree-hugging utilities? The politics of phasing out coal and the unusual
   alliance that passed Oregon's clean energy transition law},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 2016, the state of Oregon passed the Oregon Clean Electricity and
   Coal Transition Plan, which doubles the state's renewable portfolio
   standard to 50\% and eliminates the use of coal-fired electricity by
   2030. The research presented here examines the central factors that
   contributed to passage of the legislation. Interviews were conducted
   with individuals closely involved in the bill's passage and who have
   extensive knowledge of energy policy in the state. The findings were
   analyzed using the Multiple Streams Approach, which analyzes public
   policy to understand how certain items emerge onto the political agenda,
   creating opportunities for policy change. The research found that
   cooperation between the utilities and environmental groups was crucial
   to its success. Another key factor was a threatened ballot initiative
   that prompted the utilities to negotiate the alternative that was
   eventually passed in the legislature. The collaboration between the
   state's utilities and environmental groups represents an example of
   passing environmental legislation that can be emulated elsewhere.
   However, the context of the bill's passage, which took place during a
   short legislative session that did not allow for extensive consideration
   and excluded the Public Utilities Commission, also contributed to an
   erosion of trust and damaged relationships.},

Title = {Ecuador's Yasuni-ITT Initiative: Avoiding emissions by keeping petroleum
   underground},
Journal = {ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-223},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As large petroleum reserves were confirmed in the Yasuni National Park
   of Ecuador, one of the most biodiverse hotspots in the Amazonian region
   and the world, Ecuador has proposed indefinitely keeping almost a
   billion barrels of petroleum underground, if the international community
   contributes with at least half of the opportunity cost of exploiting the
   petroleum. An internationally administrated fund with UN participation
   will be created and invested exclusively in conservation, renewable
   energy and social development. The proposal has already received
   significant support from international institutions, European
   governments, NGOs and personalities worldwide.
   Ecuador, a less developed country in South America, remains dependent of
   petroleum exports, which have not led to economic growth and
   diversification, did not reduce poverty and inequality, and had strong
   environmental impacts. Given the limits of petroleum reserves, the
   Yasuni-ITT initiative opens alternatives towards sustainable development
   in the country, allowing a transition towards a post-petroleum society,
   and promoting ways towards human development within the limits of
   biodiversity conservation.
   This proposal, which can be replicated by other developing countries
   with fossil fuel reserves in biodiverse areas, opens new alternatives
   for post-Kyoto negotiations with binding commitments for several
   developing countries, and simultaneously addresses global warming,
   biodiversity loss, and poverty. In addition, it addresses national and
   international environmental justice.
   The article summarizes the proposal within the post-Kyoto context, and
   discusses relevant topics, such as its significance for Ecuador's
   development performance and future, as well as national and
   international environmental justice. (C) 2009 International Energy

Title = {Global assessment of historical, current and forecast ocean energy
   infrastructure: Implications for marine space planning, sustainable
   design and end-of-engineered-life management},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Thousands of structures are currently installed in our oceans to help
   meet our global energy needs. This number is set to increase with the
   transition to renewable energy, due to lower energy yield per structure,
   growing energy demand and greater and more diverse use of ocean space
   (e.g. for food, industrial or scientific activity). A clear and
   comprehensive picture of the spatial and temporal distribution of ocean
   energy assets is crucial to inform marine spatial planning, sustainable
   design of ocean infrastructure and end-of-engineered-life management, to
   prevent an exponentially increasing asset base becoming an economic and
   environmental burden. Here we define the spatial and temporal dimensions
   of the challenge that lies before us through creation of a comprehensive
   global dataset of past, current and forecast ocean energy infrastructure
   and offshore energy resources, both hydrocarbon and wind, for the period
   1960-2040. The data is collected together for the first time and made
   available in the public domain through an interactive online map. The
   resulting oceanscape provides insight into the type, quantity, density
   and geographic centres of the accumulating asset base, which in turn
   enables informed consideration of how marine space alongside design and
   end-of-engineered-life of ocean infrastructure can be managed
   responsibly and sustainably.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In accordance with critical reflective thinking on colonialisation, we
   respond to Dunlap's critical remarks on our article by deconstructing
   some of the themes presented in the debate on internal colonialism in
   the context of large-scale wind energy developments in the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec, Mexico. We return to a historical conceptualisation of
   internal colonialism as it pertains to a continuation of colonial-like
   dynamics - oppression, repression, violation and exploitation of
   vulnerable people - within a country, which is important for our
   discussion on energy justice, particularly cognitive justice, as the
   colonial-like dynamics of economic transactions between economically
   motivated indigenous people and private investors with the support of
   elite actors - which we term transactional colonialism - have
   repercussions for vulnerable people and indigenous livelihoods. We hope
   that our perspective will contribute to the global discussion of the
   socio-ecological impacts of large-scale wind energy developments and
   green transitions more generally.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {25-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A growing scholarship argues that decarbonization cannot be achieved
   with single instruments like carbon pricing alone. A broader mix of
   reinforcing policies is required. This literature focuses on how
   policies can accelerate technological innovation, restrict polluting
   activities, promote green growth, and ensure social justice. Applying
   the policy mix literature to the European Union (EU), this article
   examines the development of climate and energy policies from separate
   and narrow initiatives to coordinated policy packages to achieve
   increasingly ambitious climate targets, culminating with the European
   Green Deal. The starting point to explain this policy development is
   that EU policies will reflect the positions of the `least ambitious'
   actors when unanimity is required. Examination of different policy
   phases shows that EU policy mixes are not only needed to fulfil
   different transition functions-they also provide opportunities to
   combine different actor interests to raise climate ambitions. The EU
   institutions have been instrumental in crafting policy packages that
   exempt and compensate the least climate-ambitious actors. The Paris
   Agreement has also provided an enabling context for higher EU ambitions.
   Looking towards the future, the corona-induced recession has so far
   mainly been used by the EU as an opportunity to strengthen climate
   ambitions and the European Green Deal.},

Title = {Livestock Farming at the Expense of Water Resources? The
   Water-Energy-Food Nexus in Regions with Intensive Livestock Farming},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Policymaking in the water-energy-food nexus is characterized by complex
   ecological, social, and economic interdependencies. Nexus research
   assumes these interactions to be overseen in the respective resource
   governance resulting in sectoral perspectives contributing to
   unsustainable outcomes. In Germany, the political priority given to the
   formation of an internationally competitive livestock sector by means of
   intensification, specialization and regional concentration has exerted
   sustained pressure on water and soil resources. The expansion of
   bioenergy plants promoted by the renewable energy act has exacerbated
   the situation. Despite the persistency of the ecological challenges,
   German policymakers only reacted when the European Commission referred
   Germany to the European Court of Justice. Current policy efforts to
   tackle the ecological problems are now provoking disruptions in the
   agrarian sector in regions with high nitrate concentrations in water
   resources. By combining the social-ecological systems framework with
   hypotheses derived from nexus research, we explore the interactions
   between food, water and energy systems and aim at understanding the
   unsustainable outcomes. We argue that the non-consideration of the
   complex interdependencies between the agricultural, the water and the
   energy system in policymaking and the divergence of policy goals
   constitute a major cause of unsustainable governance.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},

Volume = {108},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {524-537},
Abstract = {Legacies of social and environmental injustices can leave an imprint on
   the present and constrain transitions for more sustainable futures. In
   this article, we ask this question: What is the relationship of
   environmental inequality and histories of segregation? The answer for
   Baltimore is complex, where past practices of de jure and de facto
   segregation have created social and environmental legacies that persist
   on the landscape today. To answer this question, we examine the
   interactions among past and current environmental injustices in
   Baltimore from the late 1880s to the present using nearly twenty years
   of social and environmental justice research from the Baltimore
   Ecosystem Study (BES), a long-term social-ecological research project.
   Our research demonstrates that patterns and procedures in the city's
   early history of formal and informal segregation, followed by
   ``redlining{''} in the 1930s, have left indelible patterns of social and
   environmental inequalities. These patterns are manifest in the
   distribution of environmental disamenities such as polluting industries,
   urban heat islands, and vulnerability to flooding, and they are also
   evident in the distribution of environmental amenities such as parks and
   trees. Further, our work shows how these legacies are complicated by
   changing perceptions of what counts as an environmental disamenity and
   amenity. Ultimately, we argue that the interactions among historical
   patterns, processes, and procedures over the long term are crucial for
   understanding environmental injustices of the past and present and for
   constructing sustainable cities for the future.},

Title = {Participatory Impetus for and Forms of Citizens' Co-Owned Power Plants:
   Cases from Higashi-Ohmi, Japan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Citizen-led local participation is considered the key to a successful
   energy transition, and citizens' co-owned power plants are an
   alternative and representative form of local participation. The extent
   to which citizens' co-owned power plants can embody ``locality,
   democracy, participation, energy autonomy, poverty reduction, and energy
   justice{''} has led to many controversial discussions. In response to
   these meaningful questions, this study argues for the focus to return to
   the impetus and driving forces of local participation in energy. This
   study proposes six possibilities for the impetus of local energy
   participation and the types of participation they may create. In the
   case analysis of the Higashi-Ohmi Model, in addition to the compound
   disaster of the 11 March 2011 earthquake and the transformation of the
   Japanese power grid, the driving factors depend on the
   self-consciousness of local promoters who insist on independence from
   policy influence. By linking local networks to discuss ``local
   needs,{''} the residents form an integrated plan of ``agricultural
   self-sufficiency, care system, and energy autonomy.{''} They promote the
   overall economic cycle of the region with energy regional energy
   currency, which inspired other rural forms of citizen energy
   participation. In addition, the simultaneous development of small-scale
   local enterprises and the ability of the local government to adjust
   policies centered on the needs of residents are important conditions for
   implementing the Higashi-Ohmi model.},

Abstract = {The energy transition has provided a framework for designing and
   implementing renewable energy policies in a growing number of countries
   in recent years. The discourse from both international energy
   organisations and national governments around these renewable energy
   policies highlights its -supposed- sustainable nature. However, much
   evidence shows that the ``renewable{''} component of these energy
   policies and the impact on local communities' sustainable development
   are much smaller than what is claimed in their discourse. This paper
   analyses the Mazar-Dudas hydropower project (Ecuador) case study, which
   is officially classified as a small renewable energy project (21 MW)
   with presumable low environmental impact and significant positive
   effects on sustainability of local communities. Although, the
   sustainability associated with hydropower production is one of the most
   controversial aspects of this energy production technology. Based on
   interviews with relevant actors and the subsequent thematic content
   analysis, the results highlight that the environmental impact is
   perceived as significant, contrary to what it is said in the official
   discourse. Additionally, the benefit-sharing scheme's effects of this
   hydropower project are far below expectations.},

Title = {Towards a theory of just transition: A neo-Gramscian understanding of
   how to shift development pathways to zero poverty and zero carbon},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a global community, we need to understand better how a just
   transition can shift development paths to achieve net zero emissions and
   eliminate poverty. Our past development trajectories have led to high
   emissions, persistent inequality and a world that is fragmented across
   multiple contradictions. How can countries shift to development pathways
   that deliver zero poverty and zero carbon? In developing a theory of
   just transition, the article begins by reviewing a range of theoretical
   approaches from different traditions, building in particular on
   neo-Gramscian approaches. It applies and modifies core components of
   Gramsci's approach, building a neoGramscian theory of just transitions
   around concepts of ideology, hegemony, change agents and fundamental
   conditions. The theory suggests how coalitions of change agents can come
   together behind a just transition. The coalition needs to gain broader
   support, establish a new cultural hegemony in support of just
   transitions and be able to transform the fundamental conditions of the
   21st century. The article briefly considers how this better
   understanding can be applied to the practice of shifting development
   pathways. The penultimate section reflects on limitations, including
   that a fuller development of a theory of just transition will require
   application for detailed concrete examples and a community effort.
   Together, we might address the multiple challenges of our present
   conditions to transition to development that enables human flourishing
   and a healthy planet.},

Title = {Transforming Access to Clean Energy Technologies in the Global South:
   Learning from Lighting Africa in Kenya},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As SDG7-related interventions seek to transform access to clean energy,
   this paper presents an analysis of both a previous transformative
   intervention (Lighting Africa) and a theoretical approach to
   understanding how such transformations can be achieved in the Global
   South (socio-technical innovation system, STIS, building). The paper
   makes four contributions. First, it tests the extent to which the
   STIS-building concept is useful in understanding and conceptualising how
   Lighting Africa transformed the market for solar lanterns in Kenya from
   an estimated market size of 29,000 lamps in 2009 to one where 680,000
   Lighting Africa certified lamps were sold in Kenya by the end of the
   Programme in 2013. Second, it presents the most in-depth analysis of
   Lighting Africa that we are aware of to date. Third, it presents a
   conceptual framework that illustrates the Lighting Africa approach,
   providing a framework for future policy interventions aiming to
   transform access to clean energy technologies in the Global South.
   Fourth, it reflects on weaknesses in the STIS approach. In particular,
   these include a need to better attend to: the gendered implications of
   interventions (and social justice more broadly); implications of
   different scales of technologies; value accumulation and the extent to
   which interventions benefit indigenous actors and local economies; and
   the political and economic implications of any intervention and its
   distribution of benefits.},

Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {1461-1478},
Abstract = {Cities throughout the world are key sites for energy sustainability
   activities. However, analysis of such efforts to date has focused on a
   sub-set of atypical cities: early adopters and/or world cities. This
   article undertakes a case-study analysis for an ordinary city,
   Philadelphia, PA in order to assess the extent to which prior research
   provides adequate policy explanation for ordinary cities and to gain
   empirical insight on two under-researched aspects: policy actors, and
   the policy-making and implementation sites (action sites) for urban
   energy sustainability. Overall, the types of policy drivers, modes of
   governance, and enabling factors and barriers in the Philadelphia case
   fit with prior studies. Focusing on actors and action sites, however,
   offers insight on the city's relative policy-making approach based on
   ``non-controversy{''}, the key role of third-sector actors in both
   policy-making and implementation, and the diversification of action
   sites through external-level policymaking operationalised locally
   nevertheless at the expense of reduced control by urban actors. These
   findings lead to recommendations for urban energy sustainability

Title = {Potential of the `Renewable Energy Exodus' (a mass rural remigration)
   for massive GHG reduction in Japan},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {623-632},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {For the utilization of renewable energy from sources widely distributed
   in low-density non-urban areas the grid augmentation for its
   transmission to urban areas of high population density is often
   discussed under the premise that the present demand distribution remains
   invariant. Instead of grid augmentation, this study examined an
   alternative option of creating a power demand close to renewable sources
   and inducing population movements (i.e., Renewable Energy Exodus).
   First, the capacity of renewable energy to maintain populations in hilly
   and mountainous farming areas of japan was evaluated from two
   perspectives: Task (1) a challenging nationwide balance based on
   possible energy demand saving scenario for the future, and Task (2) a
   conservative nationwide balance based on the current per capita energy
   demand and on the region-by-region generation-consumption matching
   concept. Because Task (2) indicated that Hokkaido, the northern-most
   island, has a huge capacity, Task (3) was conducted for Hokkaido by
   examining both energy balance and economic evaluation including job
   creation for the following two scenarios: (A) a supply to Tokyo scenario
   and (B) a local demand generation scenario, keeping the same
   conservativeness as Task (2) by using the current data for energy
   consumption per capita. The nationwide Renewable Energy Exodus estimates
   gave 48 million people for Task (1) (with the future per capita energy
   demand) and 10 million people for Task (2) (with the current per capita
   energy demand and region-by-region self-sustained balance),
   respectively. For Hokkaido Task (3) (with an additional economic
   assessment) gave 1 million people. The Renewable Energy Exodus concept
   combined with the green economy promotion was found to have a
   significant merit for a sustainable future of countries like Japan where
   economic and social disparities are serious between urban areas and
   non-urban areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Who promotes sustainability? Five theses on the relationships between
   the degrowth and the environmental justice movements},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental destructions, overconsumption and overdevelopment are felt
   by an increasing number of people. Voices for `prosperity without
   growth' have strengthened and environmental conflicts are on the rise
   worldwide. This introduction to the special issue explores the
   possibility of an alliance between post-growth and ecological
   distribution conflicts (EDCs). It argues that among the various branches
   of post-growth and EDCs, degrowth and environmental justice (EJ)
   movements have the best potential to interconnect. This claim is
   discussed via five `theses': We argue that both degrowth and EJ
   movements are materialist but also more than just materialist in scope
   (thesis I) and both seek a politico-metabolic reconfiguration of our
   economies (thesis II). We also show that both degrowth and EJ seek
   consequential as well as deontological justice (thesis III) and they are
   complementary: while EJ has not developed a unified and broader
   theoretical roadmap, degrowth has largely failed to connect with a wider
   social movement (thesis IV). Finally, both degrowth and EJ stress the
   contradiction between capitalist accumulation vs. conditions of social
   reproduction (rather than that between capital and labour) (thesis V).
   We conclude that an alliance between degrowth and EJ is not only
   possible but necessary.},

Title = {Coal and climate change},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {This overview adopts a critical social science perspective to examine
   the state of play and potential futures for coal in the context of
   climate change. It introduces key trends in coal consumption, production
   and trade, before reviewing the relevant literature. Finding
   surprisingly little literature directly focused on coal and climate
   change, it appraises existing work and highlights key areas for future
   research. In addition to established literatures on the situated
   politics of coal and the political economy of coal, new work calling for
   demand side policies to be supplemented with supply side policies
   highlights the increasing importance of normative contestations in
   driving debates over coal. This suggests that scholars must engage much
   more directly with climate change as an issue, and particularly with the
   place of coal in a just transition. Because of coal's mammoth
   contribution to climate change and the complex political economy which
   drives its production and consumption, it is likely that coal will
   remain at the center of difficult questions about the relationship
   between climate action and development for quite some time. This article
   is categorized under: Climate and Development > Decoupling Emissions

Title = {EU Carbon Diplomacy: Assessing Hydrogen Security and Policy Impact in
   Australia and Germany},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hydrogen is fast becoming a new international ``super fuel{''} to
   accelerate global climate change ambitions. This paper has two
   inter-weaving themes. Contextually, it focuses on the potential impact
   of the EU's new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on fossil
   fuel-generated as opposed to green hydrogen imports. The CBAM, as a
   transnational carbon adjustment mechanism, has the potential to impact
   international trade in energy. It seeks both a level playing field
   between imports and EU internal markets (subject to ambitious EU climate
   change policies), and to encourage emissions reduction laggards through
   its ``carbon diplomacy{''}. Countries without a price on carbon will be
   charged for embodied carbon in their supply chains when they export to
   the EU. Empirically, we focus on two hydrogen export/import case
   studies: Australia as a non-EU state with ambitions to export hydrogen,
   and Germany as an EU Member State reliant on energy imports. Energy
   security is central to energy trade debates but needs to be
   conceptualized beyond supply and demand economics to include
   geopolitics, just transitions and the impacts of border carbon taxes and
   EU carbon diplomacy. Accordingly, we apply and further develop a
   seven-dimension energy security-justice framework to the examples of
   brown, blue and green hydrogen export/import hydrogen operations, with
   varying carbon-intensity supply chains, in Australia and Germany.
   Applying the framework, we identify potential impact-risks and
   opportunities-associated with identified brown, blue and green hydrogen
   export/import projects in the two countries. This research contributes
   to the emerging fields of international hydrogen trade, supply chains,
   and international carbon diplomacy and develops a potentially useful
   seven-dimension energy security-justice framework for energy researchers
   and policy analysts.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Using data from two recently available living standards surveys, we
   trace the dynamics in cooking fuel choice among Ghanaian households over
   the period 2005/6 and 2012/13 and further investigate the main forces
   driving households' choice of a cooking fuel. Evidence from this paper
   reveals a significant transition from fuelwood use towards LPG over the
   period. Results further reveal factors such as price, reliability in
   supply of LPG, income and other household attributes as significant
   factors influencing households choice of a given energy type for
   cooking. Relevant policy prescriptions are offered to engender
   sustainable energy use and reduce over-reliance on the already depleted
   forest resources for biomass energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Coastal communities, blue economy and the climate crisis: Framing just
   disruptions},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Current framing of the blue economy is problematic and deficient in a
   number of key aspects, specifically in terms of how resilience and
   justice are currently understood and applied in blue economy discourse.
   A more holistic and comprehensive understanding and framing of what a
   sustainable blue economy is, is required to avoid perpetuation of the
   ecological and social problems of conventional economic growth. New
   understandings of blue economy which place justice, resilience, and
   sustainability centrally are required if the blue economy concept is to
   retain credibility in the context of ongoing climate disruptions,
   socio-economic challenges, and the progressive degradation of coastal
   ecosystems. The blue economy needs to represent a practical, real-world
   solution to these issues for coastal communities striving for
   sustainability. While ideas of ``just transition{''} have been afforded
   considerable attention in the literature, here the argument is forwarded
   for a ``just disruptions{''} approach, underpinned by presentation of a
   novel framework. The ``just disruptions{''} framework posits that
   rights-based and capabilities-based approaches to justice, including
   principles of distributive and procedural justice, be applied to inform
   adaptive and resilience focused responses in coastal zones. Applying
   these principles in practice, the realities of space, place, scale, and
   power relations need to be acknowledged and more deliberately
   considered. Such a framing is urgently required to firmly ground debates
   on blue growth and blue economy in the imperatives of resilience, and
   social and ecological sustainability.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During spring 2020, the world was shocked at the imminent global spread
   of SARS-CoV-2, resorting to measures such as domestic confinement. This
   meant the reconfiguration of life in an unusual space; the home.
   However, not all households experienced it in the same way; many of them
   were vulnerable. A general increase in energy consumption and discomfort
   in many cases, led these families to suffer the ravages of confinement.
   This study analyzes the energy and comfort situation for the Madrid
   (Spain) population, according to the configuration of the homes, the
   characteristics of the dwellings, the vulnerability index by district,
   and energy poverty (measured with the 10\% threshold of energy
   expenditure of home incomes). The results show a greater exposure, in
   confinement, of vulnerable and energy-poor households to scenarios of
   discomfort in the home, to which they could not respond, while energy
   consumption inevitably increased. Driven by need, energy-poor homes
   applied certain saving strategies, mainly resorting to thermal
   adaptation with clothing. This study shows the risk these households
   experienced in the face of an extreme situation, and invites reflection
   on preventive and containment measures that aim to avoid harming the
   disadvantaged in the future; harm that would also entail serious
   consequences on the health of their cohabitants.},

Abstract = {The decarbonisation of energy systems is leading to a reconfiguration of
   the geographies of energy. One example is the emergence of community
   energy, which has become a popular object of study for geographers.
   Although widely acknowledged to be a contested, capacious, and flexible
   term, ``community energy{''} is commonly presented as singular, bounded,
   and localised. In this paper, we challenge this conception of community
   energy by considering evidence about the role and influence of three
   categories of actors: community, state, and private sector. We
   demonstrate how community energy projects are unavoidably entangled with
   a diversity of actors and institutions operating at and across multiple
   scales. We therefore argue that community energy is enabled and
   constituted by trans-scalar assemblages of overlapping actors, which
   demands multi-sectoral participation and coordination. We point to the
   need for further academic attention on the boundaries between these
   actors to better understand the role of different intermediary practices
   and relationships in facilitating the development of decentralised
   energy systems with just outcomes.},

Journal = {WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Saving energy at home is often portrayed as the ``low-hanging fruit{''}
   of climate change solutions, yet little is known about its labor or
   gendering. To understand these aspects of climate change mitigation more
   broadly, this research uses a case study of the U.S. transition to
   energy efficient lighting. The results show that even though using
   efficient bulbs is commonly portrayed as easy, it can involve six phases
   of additional labor. The case of CFLs indicates that home climate
   practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work,
   particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts
   in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties. Because home
   climate practices like using CFLs are the kind of work traditionally
   performed by women, they can expand the gender ``climate gap{''} and are
   often devalued in inequitable ways. This research illuminates the
   importance of making the labor and gendering of environmental practices
   visible.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Powerful coal interests construct activists as radical ``others{''} who
   oppose mountaintop removal at the expense of jobs, but how can we
   deconstruct these ``other{''} identities? Focusing on the Coal River
   Valley in West Virginia, where miners have opposed environmental justice
   activists, I examine how these oppositional groups-activists and
   miners-can build power by engaging in deconstructive bridging. Drawing
   on semi-structured interviews, I diagnose the affective barriers to
   miners' participation in the environmental justice movement and explore
   how activists have attempted to bridge to miners. I unpack the
   differences between activists and miners and present the miner
   mountaineer consciousness, or a sense of linked fate with those in the
   community rather than with the industry, to explain how activists and
   miners could stand together. While barriers between activists and miners
   persist, bridging attempts to deconstruct difference by emphasizing
   shared positive place-based attachments and negative affective
   industrial attachments. In the context of intractable environmental and
   social conflicts, the study builds on how deconstructing ``other{''}
   identities undercuts the powerful by aligning workers and
   environmentalists.},

Title = {Is Dandelion Rubber More Natural? Naturalness, Biotechnology and the

Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {In the unfolding debate on the prospects, challenges and viability of
   the imminent transition towards a `Bio-Based Society' (BBS) or
   `Bio-based Economy'aEuro{''}i.e. the replacement of fossil fuels by
   biomass as a basic resource for the production of energy, materials and
   food, `big' concepts tend to play an important role, such as, for
   instance, `sustainability', `global justice' and (last but not least)
   `naturalness'. The latter concept is, perhaps, the most challenging and
   intriguing one. In public debates concerning biotechnological
   interactions with the natural environment, the use of terms such as
   `nature' and `naturalness' is both inevitable and hazardous (given the
   fact that they are so notoriously difficult to define). Indeed, various
   conflicting interpretations of naturalness play a role on both sides
   (pro- and con) of the current debate. This paper aims to analyse and
   critically assess the role of `nature-speak' in the BBS transition. We
   will begin with a concise overview of the vicissitudes of the
   nature-concept so far, focussing on how modern science and technology
   have challenged and affected our understanding of what nature is.
   Subsequently, we describe how `naturalness' functions in the unfolding
   BBS debate. Finally, we will focus on a particular case study, namely
   the production of rubber with the help of natural latex coming from
   dandelion plants rather than from (tropical) rubber trees. On the one
   hand, this is presented as a more natural and nature-friendly way of
   producing rubber. On the other hand, it is a sophisticated process,

Abstract = {Rapid roll-out of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is a key component of
   decarbonising energy systems. Yet clear risks are involved, including
   footprints from land use and infrastructure as well as socio-economic
   inequalities. Where are the critical decisions about solar roll-out
   made, by whom, and to what effect for justice? The paper reviews and
   synthesises emerging scholarship on solar PV roll-out, cross-sectoral
   aspects of this multi-scalar energy transition, and energy justice. We
   identify a trend of diverse scalar biases, and highlight considerable
   emerging research on risks of scalar injustice and the policy
   adjustments required to avoid them during rapid solar roll-out.},

Title = {Transitioning From Urban Climate Action to Climate Equity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings Historically, urban climate
   action plans have not focused on residents who are most vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change: neighborhoods of people of color and
   low-income communities, also known as frontline communities. I examined
   the climate action planning process for five U.S. cities that have
   recently updated their climate action plans to focus on equity: Austin
   (TX), Baltimore (MD), Cleveland (OH), Portland (OR), and Providence
   (RI). The goal of the analysis was to identify how planners and
   policymakers are making the climate action planning process more
   inclusive of marginalized groups and incorporating equity into the
   plan's goals. I examined three aspects of climate equity: procedural,
   distributional, and recognition. Using content analysis of the plans and
   interviews with past and current sustainability directors in each of the
   cities and a small number of participants, I provide context for how the
   updated plans addressed the three aspects of equity. Further, I call
   into question how academics have defined procedural equity. The
   experiences of these five cities revealed that three actions essential
   to achieving authentic participation are antiracism training,
   comprehensive efforts to bring underrepresented groups to the table, and
   creating a planning process in which participants are valued. The bottom
   line in all three is that procedural equity is a trust-building process.
   Participants in these planning processes viewed acknowledging previous
   rounds of harm committed in frontline communities as a first step in
   prioritizing equity. Although distributional equity is defined through
   implementation, the plans of these five cities, to varying degrees,
   attempted to stipulate how equitable implementation of goals will be
   measured. Takeaway for practice Developing climate plans that emphasize
   equity requires a considerable upfront commitment to building authentic
   participation from frontline communities and ensuring that it is
   measured in implementation.},

Title = {Should All Cars Be Electric by 2025? The Electric Car Debate in Europe},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The car is still the most common mode of transport in Western countries,
   particularly so across the European Union, as it accounts for about
   two-thirds of daily commuting. So far, measures aiming to reduce
   automobile traffic and incentives for the modal shift to public
   transport and non-polluting methods of travel (walking, cycling, etc.)
   have had little effect. Moreover, the car lies at the core of a very
   complex system that has proven to be difficult to unlock. In light of
   these challenges, using new types of engine power may appear to be a
   solution. Electric vehicles have the potential to improve the
   efficiency, affordability, and sustainability of the transport system.
   However, there remains much uncertainty as to how such a transition from
   one type of engine to another may unfold, and where it could take place
   within the European context. In June 2017, the H2020 project
   SHAPE-ENERGY launched an online debate on the Debating Europe platform
   with the question: Should all cars be electric by 2025?. The aim of the
   debate was to elicit citizens views on whether the goal could be
   reached, how and with which consequences. The diversity of the vantage
   points that have appeared in the subsequent discussion generated by the
   strands of debate allows us to bring into discussion the viewpoints and
   arguments that are not often addressed in the literature on the adoption
   of electric cars in a comprehensive way. The article sheds light on
   those debates across Europe, in order to bring new insights to European
   policymakers that are seeking to promote the market for electric
   vehicles. It also broadens the scope and offers important contributions
   to scholarly debates on the diffusion and adoption of such vehicles.},

Abstract = {The Chinese ``coal-to-gas{''} and ``coal-to-electricity{''} strategies
   aim at reducing dispersed coal consumption and related air pollution by
   promoting the use of clean and low-carbon fuels in northern China. Here,
   we show that on top of meteorological influences, the effective emission
   mitigation measures achieved an average decrease of fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) concentrations of-14\% in Beijing and surrounding areas
   (the ``2+26{''} pilot cities) in winter 2017 compared to the same period
   of 2016, where the dispersed coal control measures contributed-60\% of
   the total PM2.5 reductions. However, the localized air quality
   improvement was accompanied by a contemporaneous-15\% upsurge of PM2.5
   concentrations over large areas in southern China. We find that the
   pollution transfer that resulted from a shift in emissions was of a high
   likelihood caused by a natural gas shortage in the south due to the
   coal-to-gas transition in the north. The overall shortage of natural gas
   greatly jeopardized the air quality benefits of the coal-to-gas strategy
   in winter 2017 and reflects structural challenges and potential threats
   in China's clean-energy transition.},

Title = {Ordering theories: Typologies and conceptual frameworks for

Journal = {SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Number = {5},
Pages = {703-750},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {What theories or concepts are most useful at explaining socio technical
   change? How can - or cannot - these be integrated? To provide an answer,
   this study presents the results from 35 semi-structured research
   interviews with social science experts who also shared more than two
   hundred articles, reports and books on the topic of the acceptance,
   adoption, use, or diffusion of technology. This material led to the
   identification of 96 theories and conceptual approaches spanning 22
   identified disciplines. The article begins by explaining its research
   terms and methods before honing in on a combination of fourteen theories
   deemed most relevant and useful by the material. These are:
   Sociotechnical Transitions, Social Practice Theory, Discourse Theory,
   Domestication Theory, Large Technical Systems, Social Construction of
   Technology, Sociotechnical Imaginaries, Actor-Network Theory, Social
   Justice Theory, Sociology of Expectations, Sustainable Development,
   Values Beliefs Norms Theory, Lifestyle Theory, and the Unified Theory of
   Acceptance and Use of Technology. It then positions these theories in
   terms of two distinct typologies. Theories can be placed into five
   general categories of being centered on agency, structure, meaning,
   relations or norms. They can also be classified based on their
   assumptions and goals rooted in functionalism, interpretivism, humanism
   or conflict. The article lays out tips for research methodology before
   concluding with insights about technology itself, analytical processes
   associated with technology, and the framing and communication of
   results. An interdisciplinary theoretical and conceptual inventory has
   much to offer students, analysts and scholars wanting to study
   technological change and society.},

Abstract = {Understanding how ecological distribution conflicts (EDCs) have changed
   through the transition from socialism to capitalism in the European
   semi-periphery can provide valuable lessons for global efforts towards
   sustainability. This article traces the social, political and economic
   origins of EDCs, and evaluates the outcomes of the 74 most illustrative
   cases of such conflicts from five ex-Yugoslav countries reported in the
   Environmental Justice Atlas (EJatlas): Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
   Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. It analyses how the occurrence and
   characteristics of the conflicts changed through three distinct phases
   in the region's history, i.e., the periods of Socialism (1945-1990),
   Transition (1991-2003), and EU-accession (2004-present), each
   characterised by different socio-metabolic, political and institutional
   profiles. The article also evaluates the level of environmental justice
   (EJ) in the region. The greatest diversity of conflicts were identified
   in the last phase, a period characterised by an increase in material and
   energy flows through a number of controversial projects, many of which
   arose as a result of `modernisation'. Fortunately, the resulting
   `unsustainabilities' were immediately politicised by EJ movements, whose
   composition, demands and success differed in line with changing dominant
   political and institutional conditions. Currently, the EJ movements in
   ex-Yugoslavia are led by national NGOs, while urban movements embrace
   the broadest spectrum of socio-environmental issues. Timely mobilisation
   and support from local authorities have been crucial for the successful
   resolution of conflicts. However, EJ movements have proved impotent to
   resist projects deemed to be of national economic interest in contexts
   characterised by high levels of corruption and low political
   accountability. Stronger alliances among different movements would
   assure more EJ and lasting sustainability solutions in the region.},

Title = {Gender, sexuality, and feminist critiques in energy research: A review
   and call for transversal thinking},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article presents a narrative review of recent energy research that
   engages with critical sexuality, gender, and feminist theories. We find
   that these important theories are generally considered by the literature
   in three ways through identifying and framing the problem, designing
   implementation and governance processes, and offering long-term
   visioning and ideals. Emerging scholarship advances valuable insights on
   the unequal treatment of women and other minority groups. However, our
   review also highlights the need for more transversal ways - i.e.,
   reading across disciplinary silos and multiple intersecting social
   identities - to interrogate the impacts of systemic oppression on energy
   issues. We argue that such a transversal approach to energy studies
   should prioritize engendering an epistemic community that promotes a
   relational awareness of historic and contemporary structures of
   oppression, facilitate innovative methodological approaches to research,
   and speak to more radical societal visions through mobilization and
   activism.},

Abstract = {In a commentary essay, Westman and Castan Broto claim that some choices

   environmental studies ({''}Transcending Existing Paradigms: The Quest

   26(5), 536-541). In contrast, this commentary argues that there can be
   benefits from research projects that have analytic distinctions between
   and within sustainability and justice goals in addition to having
   analytic categories that consider justice and sustainability together.
   Moreover, projects that focus on one or more sectors with
   sector-specific research questions, and that focus on goals or frames,
   can also contribute interesting and novel research in the field. Should
   such choices of method and analytic strategy be stigmatised or devalued,
   the research field would lose some of its analytic diversity and
   robustness. This commentary points to conditions under which such
   approaches can be beneficial to improved knowledge in both environmental
   research fields and political fields, and it outlines the types of
   research questions that can be lost by devaluing such analytic choices.},

Title = {Quantifying the social equity state of an energy system: environmental
   and labor market equity of the shale gas boom in Appalachia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A fundamental societal concern in energy system transitions is the
   distribution of benefits and costs across populations. A recent
   transition, the US shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic
   energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity
   implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in
   public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and
   demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional
   equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in
   the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as
   well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to
   assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air
   quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas
   supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect
   to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (y) = 0.93),
   consumption for electric power generation (77 = 0.68), commercial,
   industrial, and residential end use (77 = 0.72), job creation (77 =
   0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (77 = 0.77), which are largely
   driven by geographicallyfixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air
   quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by
   natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for
   example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000
   people) for the lowest income class (<\$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is
   higher (18\%-31\%) than for the highest income class (>\$150 000; m =
   0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than
   non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of
   the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas
   development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing
   counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8\% 1.0\%)
   and poverty rates (9.9\% 1.7\%) during the boom, although household
   income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a
   systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3
   (<1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies
   spatially (-1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created),
   wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most
   producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We
   also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment
   impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are
   largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (c),
   which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal
   that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in
   air and climate impacts (c = 1.1 and c = 1.3, respectively). The metrics
   applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing
   policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities
   mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example,
   in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to
   facilitate decisions related to the siting oflow-carbon infrastructure
   such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase -out of
   fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in
   distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and
   employment effects.},

Title = {Social Innovation for a Just Sustainable Development: Integrating the
   Wellbeing of Future People},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Social innovation has gained increased attention as a mechanism for
   sustainable development. As the Brundtland Commission highlights, the
   improvement of present conditions should not compromise future
   generations' needs. So far, (social) sustainable development has mostly
   focused on the amelioration of contemporary people's wellbeing,
   relegating its duties towards future generations to second place. Given
   this, I consider it necessary to (re-)direct social innovation towards
   the promotion of the wellbeing of future people. I propose the concept
   of irreplaceable goods, a notion deriving from a strong sustainability
   perspective, which could then be integrated into social innovation
   practices related to sustainable development. Focusing on guaranteeing,
   at least, sufficient fruition of certain goods and resources, I devise
   this concept as a governance tool for steering development actions
   towards intergenerational justice, driven by social innovation action.
   In this article, we firstly delineate the relations between sustainable
   development and social innovation, while focusing on `value-driven'
   social innovation. Afterward, I shortly introduce strong sustainability
   as support for future generations' wellbeing. Furthermore, I develop the
   concept of irreplaceable goods as a governance tool in social innovation
   practices and finalize with a discussion on the application of
   irreplaceable goods in the assessment of sustainable development
   strategies.},

Title = {A Transition to Which Bioeconomy? An Exploration of Diverging
   Techno-Political Choices},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To date the concept of the bioeconomy-an economy based primarily on
   biogenic instead of fossil resources-has largely been associated with
   visions of ``green growth{''} and the advancement of biotechnology and
   has been framed from within an industrial perspective. However, there is
   no consensus as to what a bioeconomy should effectively look like, and
   what type of society it would sustain. In this paper, we identify
   different types of narratives constructed around this concept and carve
   out the techno-political implications they convey. We map these
   narratives on a two-dimensional option space, which allows for a rough
   classification of narratives and their related imaginaries into four
   paradigmatic quadrants. We draw the narratives from three different
   sources: (i) policy documents of national and supra-national
   authorities; (ii) stakeholder interviews; and (iii) scenarios built in a
   biophysical modelling exercise. Our analysis shows that there is a
   considerable gap between official policy papers and visions supported by
   stakeholders. At least in the case of Austria there is also a gap
   between the official strategies and the option space identified through
   biophysical modelling. These gaps testify to the highly political nature
   of the concept of the bioeconomy and the diverging visions of society
   arising from it.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Participation is an important but little understood concept in science
   and innovation. While participation promises the production of new
   knowledge, social justice, and economic growth, little research has been
   done on its contribution to innovation processes at the group level. The
   concept of imaginaries can provide a window into these processes.
   Adopting a micro-sociological perspective, we examined the interplay
   between imaginaries of participation and group development within a
   long-term ethnographic observation study of an initiative, Energy
   Avant-garde, as it pursued the development of a decentralized,
   self-contained, and entirely renewable energy system in one German
   region. We scaled down the macrolevel concept of imaginaries to the
   group level. We found that group imaginaries are a resource for bringing
   order to a group and that a group is a resource for creating,
   operationalizing, revising, and sustaining imaginaries. We describe a
   ``failure-through-success{''} story: while imaginaries initially
   promoted group cohesion, creativity, and productivity, in later stages,
   these effects were impeded by group dynamics. We therefore distinguish
   between process imaginaries and outcome imaginaries and conclude that,
   inherently, participation must be managed and employed at the
   appropriate stages to make valuable contributions.},

Abstract = {Micro-mobility market-making represents an under-studied but important
   aspect of urban transport sustainability transitions. Micro-mobility
   roll-out combines several critical elements: decarbonisation,
   digitalisation and public space interventions. We theorise the emergence
   of a micro-mobility market, drawing on innovation studies,
   micro-politics scholarship and common-ing mobility literature, and
   critically discuss the relationship between innovation and regulation in
   this emerging market. We examine e-scooter roll-out in Bergen, Norway,
   using a structured analysis that interrogates knowledge, authority and
   power. Our empirical analysis employs expert interviews and focus group
   discussions with key transport sector stakeholders, including
   poli-cymakers, practitioners and urban residents. We discuss insights in
   terms of implications for how micro-mobility markets are made and in
   turn make urban transport sustainability transitions. We argue that
   while micro-mobility can enable just low-carbon mobility transitions,
   market forces drive outcomes that may undermine urban sustainability
   agendas. We identify scope for dynamic regulation to engender low-carbon
   mobility in wider public interest.},

Title = {Induced seismicity or political ploy?: Using a novel mix of methods to
   identify multiple publics and track responses over time to shale gas
   policy change},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {81},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To date, little research has investigated how public perceptions of
   policies to ban or restrict fossil-fuel extraction change over time; yet
   this topic is of crucial importance as countries worldwide seek to
   transition towards `net zero' economies. This study addresses this gap
   by focusing on public responses to the 2019 moratorium on shale gas
   extraction in England, using an analytical framework comprising
   awareness, interpretations and opinions, and a mixed-method approach
   combining national survey, social media and local case interviews.
   Findings show high levels of awareness and support for the moratorium,
   yet differences between coalitions of interest based on ideology, scale
   and demographics. Social media analyses reveal a peak in public response
   across several days during a general election campaign in which
   different parties took divergent positions on shale gas. Public support
   for the moratorium - and induced seismicity as the primary reason for
   its introduction - was evidenced by the national survey, yet coincided
   with scepticism about its timing, extent and motivation, as indicated by
   social media activity and local case interviews. For some publics, the
   moratorium was a ploy to ensure electoral support, embedded in public
   distrust. This study indicates the merits of a mixed-method approach to
   understand the psychological and institutional context of public
   responses to policy change as it unfolds over time, and discusses the
   longer term implications of politicised attitudes for energy
   transitions.},

Abstract = {Rapid development of solar energy is reconfiguring global labour
   geographies. Beneath the formal economy of solar exists a hidden
   infra-economy of informal and marginalised labourers that toil in
   valuable yet precarious nodes of solar development (i.e. mining,
   generation, disposal). These labourers comprise a lumpenproletariat
   class (or solar lumenproletariats) that is defined by its informality,
   flexibility, precarity and disposability. Through political struggles
   and reflexivity, the lumenproletariats develop class consciousness.
   Although still precariously positioned in solar's infra-economy, they
   develop a praeclarus (Latin: ``bright{''}) understanding of their shared
   class interests and become praeclariats resisting the reproduction of
   solar capital. Solar praeclariats unified in class struggle can alter
   the exploitative relations of production and usher in a truly ``just{''}

Title = {Electric vehicle charging and end-user motivation for flexibility: a
   case study from Norway},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Background Norway is currently in the process of replacing internal
   combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs). A
   steadily increasing number of EVs being charged in the evening when the
   demand peaks are already high has added to the strain on local
   electricity grids. Smart charging is proposed as a solution to peak-load
   challenges of this kind, as it can delay charging until evenings and
   nights when demand peaks are generally low. However, current knowledge
   of the preferences and motivations of EV owners regarding the
   installation and use of smart chargers is lacking. Accordingly, the
   study aims to contribute an improved understanding in this respect.
   Methods The authors conducted a qualitative study based on
   semi-structured interviews, in which they gained information on
   householder's experiences following their participation in a pilot
   project to test smart charging of EVs. The interviews explored the
   interviewees' motivation for participating in the project, their
   experiences of using and charging EVs, and their thoughts on flexibility
   in the timing of EV charging. Interviews were recorded and transcribed
   verbatim, after which a domestication theory approach was employed to
   perform an in-depth analysis of the interview data. Results The analysis
   of the interviews revealed that the study participants had four
   motivations for participating in the smart charging demonstration
   project and engaging in the further use of smart charging: (1) the
   fire-safety aspect and speed of charging devices for EVs was better than
   charging from a socket; (2) they derived a broader interest in and more
   joy from using smart home technology; (3) attractive practical and
   economic benefits; and (4) the flexibility offered by smart charging had
   the potential to have a positive impact on physical comfort. Conclusions
   The study revealed key domestication processes unfolding in the
   Norwegian energy transition with the increasing numbers of EVs and the
   corresponding grid peaks. The findings clearly indicate that users'
   motivations go much further than simple economic rationalization, which
   should be of interest to policymakers, smart home developers, and all
   others that work with end-user flexibility in the grid.},

Title = {Policy mixes for just sustainable development in regions specialized in
   carbon-intensive industries: the case of two Norwegian petro-maritime
   regions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES},
Abstract = {Research on the Geography of Sustainability Transitions (GOST) has
   enhanced our understanding in how place-based factors condition
   sustainability transitions. Its emphasis on the geography of niche
   development, however, neglects regime-level responses to regional
   sustainably transitions imperatives. Given the urgency of sustainability
   transitions, recent sustainability transitions research has emphasized
   an active destabilization and/or phase-out of incumbent carbon-intensive
   industries. However, this poses normative and practical challenges for
   regions heavily dependent in these sectors. Here the challenge is how to
   ensure an inclusive transition. This paper contributes to GOST by
   focusing on distributional and procedural dimensions of policy mixes,
   relying on just transition and institutionalist literature. Our
   longitudinal case study of two Norwegian oil-dependent regions, Stord
   and Verdal identifies phases separated by critical junctures, with
   different policy mixes. Underpinned by the Norwegian tripartite
   cooperation model, the multi-scalar policy mixes in the regions has
   focused on the sector's decarbonization, rather than its phase-out,
   while developing renewable energy sectors through technology-push.
   Supporting short term business as usual, this provides the industry time
   to prepare for emerging renewable technologies and reducing negative
   impacts of transitions. We suggest that just sustainable development of
   such regions requires coherent multi-scalar policy mixes, and legitimacy
   and participation among key actors.},

Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This overview adopts a critical social science perspective to examine
   the state of play and potential futures for coal in the context of
   climate change. It introduces key trends in coal consumption, production
   and trade, before reviewing the relevant literature. Finding
   surprisingly little literature directly focused on coal and climate
   change, it appraises existing work and highlights key areas for future
   research. In addition to established literatures on the situated
   politics of coal and the political economy of coal, new work calling for
   demand side policies to be supplemented with supply side policies
   highlights the increasing importance of normative contestations in
   driving debates over coal. This suggests that scholars must engage much
   more directly with climate change as an issue, and particularly with the
   place of coal in a just transition. Because of coal's mammoth
   contribution to climate change and the complex political economy which
   drives its production and consumption, it is likely that coal will
   remain at the center of difficult questions about the relationship
   between climate action and development for quite some time. This article
   is categorized under: Climate and Development > Decoupling Emissions

Title = {Community Empowerment in Decarbonization: NEPA's Role},
Journal = {WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1511-1566},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This Article addresses a potential tension between two ambitions for the
   transition to clean energy: reducing regulatory red-tape to quickly
   build out renewable energy, and leveraging that build-out to empower
   low-income communities and communities of color. Each ambition carries a
   different view of communities' role in decarbonization. To those focused
   on rapid build-out of renewable energy infrastructure, communities are a
   potential threat who could slow or derail renewable energy projects
   through opposition during the regulatory process. To those focused on
   leveraging the transition to clean energy to advance racial and economic
   justice, communities are necessary partners in the key decisions of the
   transition including the development of renewable energy projects. The
   Biden Administration has committed to both ambitions, but there is a gap
   regarding what role communities will play in policies designed to
   implement decarbonization.
   This Article articulates this ``participatory gap{''} in decarbonization
   policy and proposes changes to the regulations implementing the National
   Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that start bridging these
   ambitions. The Article offers proposals that would leverage NEPA's
   unique structure to empower communities in decarbonization.
   Specifically, it argues that NEPA's regulations should be reformed to
   require meaningful community engagement and enforce that commitment
   through a revitalized executive enforcement structure. Contrary to views
   that more community engagement will slow decarbonization, this Article
   argues that these reforms would support the rapid transition to
   renewable energy while also empowering communities and elevating justice
   as a central value in environmental policy.},

Title = {Acceptability of innovative biomass heating plants in a German case
   study-a contribution to cultural landscape management and local energy
   supply},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background To prevent negative effects on the cultural landscape through
   land abandonment or agricultural intensification, innovative solutions
   towards more sustainable land use are required. Local bioenergy systems
   using agricultural co-products are perceived as one solution to
   threatened cultural landscapes with small-scale meadows. The aim of this
   paper is to analyse the acceptability of biomass heating plants in the
   Spreewald region (Germany) and their contribution to cultural landscape
   management. Methods We asked 17 farmers about the likelihood that they
   would install a biomass plant on their farms and about their reasons for
   accepting or rejecting it. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis
   was applied. Results The analysis showed that acceptance is relatively
   low. We identified three types of farmers: proponents and potential
   adopters, ethically concerned opponents, and open-minded refusers.
   Biomass plants were likely to be accepted if farmers stated an ethical
   acceptance of and interest in technology, a need for a new heating
   system, the availability of sufficient feedstock, and a perceived
   unproblematic readiness of technology-all these factors had to exist in
   combination. On the other hand, farmers rejected a biomass plant if one
   of the following factors existed: ethical concerns about ``burning
   hay{''}, satisfaction with their current oven, low availability of
   feedstock, or a perceived low readiness of technology. Other factors
   were the existence of procedural justice, trust in coordinating actors,
   and a demonstration plant. Conclusions The discussion shows that the
   specific results have to be contextualised within the innovation process
   for sustainable landscape management. This may be achieved by
   integrating the acceptability study into an adaptive landscape design.
   This relies on mutable acceptability decisions, reflexive learning
   processes, and iterative feedback loops in innovation processes. Our
   paper advances knowledge about (1) how to prevent land abandonment and
   simultaneously promote regional energy and (2) the acceptability in the
   field of land use and landscape management. Keywords Fuzzy set

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {402-414},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Within the next two decades, large areas will be converted into urban
   environments, a process that will include enormous transformations in
   economic activity, environmental health, and social justice. To address
   these complex problems, scholars use the metaphor of the ``urban
   metabolism,{''} describing an understanding of the interdependencies and
   dynamics of cities and the ecosystems they rely on. Research on urban
   metabolism has achieved important methodological advancements, such as
   descriptive analytical frameworks, decision-making models, and resource
   flow models. However, these contributions have rarely engaged with the
   transformational potential of designing sustainability solutions for
   socio-ecological dynamics. This study aims at investigating the current
   state of the urban metabolism discourse in linking material flows to
   human well-being, ecological integrity, and social justice, as well as
   the transformational potential of interventions. To accomplish this, we
   conducted multivariate statistics of 221 scientific publications,
   seeking to clarify the normative and transformational aspects considered
   in the design, context, and products of urban metabolism research.
   Results differentiated eight clusters of urban metabolism research
   highlighting the diversity of research along disciplinary and
   methodological dimensions. We identify pathways to strengthen the
   conceptualization of a ``sustainable urban metabolism{''} and conclude
   with suggestions for collaboration between urban metabolism and

Abstract = {Energy is central to both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
   and the Paris Agreement and a prerequisite to the realization of human
   rights for billions of people. Yet the nexus between human rights,
   climate change and energy remains underdeveloped in international law
   and practice. This article considers the potential and limitations of a
   `human rights approach' to energy to accelerate progress towards
   universal access to modern energy services while addressing climate
   change and inequalities. It considers three distinct elements of a human
   rights approach to energy: a discursive element; a mainstreaming
   element; and a litigation element. In exploring the potential
   contributions of each of these elements to a just energy transition, it
   demonstrates how a human rights approach to energy can help to address
   some of the shortcomings of the Sustainable Development Goals related to
   energy and climate.},

Abstract = {In La Guajira, Colombia, in the 21st century, coal mining has increased,
   and wind parks and wind turbines are being planned, which will affect
   the Wayuu people territorially, environmentally, and culturally. The
   demands of NGOs, grassroots organizations, and Wayuu leaders seek to
   position alternatives to extractivism, articulated with energy
   transition and postextractives transitions' proposals. Faced with the
   demands of local processes, companies and institutions also pose energy
   transitions, which respond to other perspectives and interests, since
   they continue to be anchored to socio-environmental and structural
   inequalities and a socioecological fix that reproduce the same effects
   of extractivism. From the critical debates on green extractivism and the
   proposals for radical socioenvironmental transformation, I analyze the
   energy transition proposals around an institutionalized governance and
   infrastructures of inequality. At the same time, I arise from the
   demands of the Wayuu people to propose that a rethinking of
   socio-environmental relationships to radical socioenvironmental
   transformations. This transformation will be based on demands of
   relational environmental justice that take up Wayuu ways of life and
   reposition human-non-human relationships under other ontologies, and
   proposals. The work was carried out collaboratively, based on an
   ethnographic work and interviews with various actors.},

Title = {A personas-based approach to deliberating local decarbonisation
   scenarios: Findings and methodological insights},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the public deeply embedded at the heart of the energy system, it is
   essential that any transition is shaped by what is socially
   acceptable/desirable at local levels, taking account of any existing
   vulnerabilities within the local community. In this paper, we present a
   detailed description of a novel method for exploring local energy
   systems change with residents of Port Talbot, an industrial town in
   south Wales. Our persona-based approach asked small groups of local
   residents to explore place-based scenarios for energy systems change
   through the development of local characters or `personas'. By situating
   deliberation within a local context and grounding it in the emotional
   relationships that matter in residents' everyday lives, persona-based
   exploration provides a useful foundation upon which to conduct
   deliberation of complex socio-technical energy issues that can otherwise
   be presented and interpreted as quite abstract and technical visions of
   change. In particular we illustrate how this approach allowed
   participants to open up about their personal lives, as well as eliciting
   more sympathetic consideration of the needs of others by better
   orienting participants to the issues of vulnerability within their
   communities. Two key processes of persona development enabled this: 1)
   the incorporation of personal identities, circumstances, or histories
   (both of themselves or friends/family) within personas, and 2) the
   embodiment of shared social understandings of local industrial and
   community decline within personas. As such, we believe that
   persona-based exploration offers a valuable tool for deepening emotional
   and context specific public deliberations around energy systems
   transitions and sociotechnical change more broadly.},

Title = {Processes of elite power and low-carbon pathways: Experimentation,
   financialisation, and dispossession},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {What is a low-carbon pathway? To many, it is a way of mitigating climate
   change. To others, it is about addressing market failure or capturing
   the co-benefits attached to low-carbon systems, such as jobs or improved
   health. To still others, it represents building adaptive capacity and
   resilience in the face of climate change. However, these interpretations
   can fail to acknowledge how pathways of low-carbon transitions can also
   become intertwined with processes and structures of inequality,
   exclusion and injustice. Using a critical lens that draws from a variety
   of disciplines, this article explores three ways through which responses
   to climate change can entrench, exacerbate or reconfigure the power of
   elites. As society attempts to create a low-carbon society, including
   for example via coastal protection efforts, disaster recovery, or
   climate change mitigation and renewable energy, these efforts intersect
   with at least three processes of elite power: experimentation,
   financialisation, and dispossession. Experimentation is when elites use
   the world as a laboratory to test or pilot low-carbon technologies or
   policy models, transferring risks yet not always sharing benefits.
   Financialisation refers to the expansion and proliferation of finance,
   capital, and financial markets in the global economy and many national
   economies, processes of which have recently extended to renewable
   energy. Dispossession is when elites use decarbonisation as a process
   through which to appropriate land, wealth, or other assets (and in the
   process make society more majoritarian and/or unequal). We explore these
   three themes using a variety of evidence across illustrative case
   studies, including hard and soft coastal protection measures
   (Bangladesh, Netherlands), climate risk insurance (Malawi), and
   renewable energy auctions and associated mechanisms of finance and
   investment (South Africa and Mexico).},

Title = {Moral Values as Factors for Social Acceptance of Smart Grid Technologies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Smart grid technologies are considered an important enabler in the
   transition to more sustainable energy systems because they support the
   integration of rising shares of volatile renewable energy sources into
   electricity networks. To implement them in a large scale, broad
   acceptance in societies is crucial. However, a growing body of research
   has revealed societal concerns with these technologies. To achieve
   sustainable energy systems, such concerns should be taken into account
   in the development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we show
   that many concerns are related to moral values such as privacy, justice,
   or trust. We explore the effect of moral values on the acceptance of
   smart grid technologies. The results of our systematic literature review
   indicate that moral values can be both driving forces and barriers for
   smart grid acceptance. We propose that future research striving to
   understand the role of moral values as factors for social acceptance can
   benefit from an interdisciplinary approach bridging literature in ethics
   of technology with technology acceptance models.},

Title = {Technological intrusion and communicative renewal: The case of two rural
   solar farm developments in the UK},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper I present findings and insights from an empirical study of
   two case study solar farm developments from rural areas of the South
   West, UK. Drawing on a Habermasian theoretical frame, I examine local
   resident narratives that emerged through the local public sphere and how
   these formed discursive meanings that provided shared background social
   norms for residents towards the solar farm developments. The paper
   begins by operationalising Habermas's theoretical ideas for empirical
   research and situating the research within existing literature. The
   theoretical and methodological sections are followed by the examination
   of three local narratives that emerged: idealised rural land use,
   farming and income generation, and money making and the pursuit of
   profit. Such narratives are considered in view of public opportunities
   for robust dialogue and debate to judge the normative democratic
   character of the solar farm developments. The paper concludes that the
   community development offered significantly more discursive space for
   debate than the commercial development and increased the developments'
   overall democratic legitimacy. It is maintained that such a Habermasian
   theoretical frame adapted for empirical analysis is valuable for
   normatively assessing democratic processes which are needed in view of
   conceptually weak accounts of `energy democracy'.},

Journal = {ONE EARTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Pages = {629-638},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {The integration of renewable generation and the electrification of
   heating and transportation are critical for the sustainable energy
   transition toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. These changes
   require the large-scale adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs).
   Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has gained attention as a new approach
   for incentivizing the uptake and coordination of DERs, with advantages
   for computational scalability, prosumer autonomy, and market
   competitiveness. However, major unresolved challenges remain for scaling
   out P2P trading, including enforcing network constraints, managing
   uncertainty, and mediating transmission and distribution conflicts.
   Here, we propose a novel multiscale design framework for P2P trading,
   with inter-platform coordination mechanisms to align local transactions
   with system-level requirements, and analytical tools to enhance
   long-term planning and investment decisions by accounting for forecast
   real-time operation. By integrating P2P trading into planning and
   operation across spatial and temporal scales, the adoption of
   large-scale DERs is tenable and can create economic, environmental, and
   social co-benefits.},

Title = {Political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental
   dimensions of electric vehicle adoption in the United States: A
   social-media interaction analysis},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many governments have begun to adopt aggressive targets for electric
   vehicles. However, studies of the drivers of electric vehicle (EV)
   adoption are scarce. Social media interactions can provide a new
   data-driven vantage point to explore such drivers. This study uses data
   from 36,000 public posts on Facebook to investigate intersectionality in
   EV-communication as per the Political, Economic, Social, Technological,
   Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) categories. A computational social
   science methodology was adopted using a mixed-method application of
   social network analysis and machine learning-based topic modelling
   through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm on a 600,000-text corpus
   extracted from the Facebook posts. Results showed that political,
   economic, and legal posts had dense clusters around the technology
   policy of EV, the institutional discourse of electrification of the
   federal vehicle fleet, and tax and credit framework politics. The
   environmental and social dimensions had a higher discourse for social
   justice, clean air, and better health and well-being. A market shift
   towards EV as a service industry was observed in the technology and
   economics-related posts. These findings can help policymakers, and
   planners design contextualised energy policy for influencing EV adoption
   in the U.S. and other countries.},

Title = {Discursive resistance to phasing out coal-fired electricity: Narratives
   in Japan's coal regime},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {782-796},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Achieving temperature targets under the Paris Agreement requires urgent
   measures to curb construction of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) and
   expediate the retirement of existing assets. As the world's fourth
   largest coal consumer, Japan's efforts to reduce coal usage are critical
   for international climate mitigation. Policies introduced after the
   Fukushima nuclear disaster have led to a rapid increase in solar.
   However deregulation of the electricity market has also prompted a rush
   of new CFPP constructions by new market entrants and incumbent
   utilities. In parallel, Japanese state agencies and industry are
   actively exporting CFPP technologies to developing countries. Although
   these domestic and international actions harbour serious consequences
   for global climate mitigation efforts, greater understanding of the
   factors driving Japan's coal dependency is needed to limit further
   lock-in of future carbon emissions. Filling this gap, this study
   critically examines narratives employed by actors in government and
   industry to sustain Japan's domestic and international coal industry.
   Our analysis shows how Japan's fossil fuel regime is employing recurring
   narratives to promote continuation of the current coal-based energy
   system and to mobilise further investments in high-efficiency coal power
   technologies. We conclude by recommending various policy pathways and
   institutional reform measures aimed at encouraging wider diffusion of
   renewable electricity sources while reducing coal dependency.},

   the geometry and dynamics of the pion-emitting system provides a
   stringent test of transport models of heavy ion collisions. Detailed
   comparisons with a realistic transport model, both with and without an
   explicit nuclear mean field, suggest that the beam energy evolution in
   the reaction dynamics is different in the model than in the data. A
   significantly increased pi(-) emission time scale, which has been
   suggested as a signal of the onset of the transition to quark-gluon
   plasma, is not observed.},

Title = {Shale gas policy in the United Kingdom: An argumentative discourse
   analysis},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {427-438},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Shale gas has become an energy policy priority in the United Kingdom in
   light of profitable extraction activities in the United States. Since
   2012 the Coalition Government has created key economic drivers to
   encourage shale exploration, whilst growing activism in affected site
   communities has stirred significant media and academic commentary. This
   study examines the growing national debate as a matter of discourse,
   adopting an argumentative discourse analytic approach to assess data
   collected from stakeholder interviews (n=21) and key policy actor
   statements quoted in broadsheet newspapers. We explore three dominant
   ``storylines{''} emerging in relation to shale gas policy: (1)
   ``cleanliness and dirt{''} concerns the relative framing of the
   environmental benefits and harms of shale gas; (2) ``energy transitions
   - pathways and diversions{''} concerns geographic metaphors of
   transitions to carbon intensive and low-carbon energy systems; and (3)
   ``geographies of environmental justice{''} concerns divisions of
   economic benefit distribution, environmental impact and procedural
   fairness. We find that central government policy rhetoric emphasises
   economic development, regulatory oversight and distribution of benefits
   to site communities, whilst minimising discussion of the implications of
   shale gas for anthropogenic climate change. The role of these discourses
   in influencing shale gas policy is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Moving toward a sustainable global society requires substantial change
   in both social and technological systems. This sustainability is
   dependent not only on addressing the environmental impacts of current
   social and technological systems, but also on addressing the social,
   economic and political harms that continue to be perpetuated through
   systematic forms of oppression and the exclusion of Black, Indigenous,
   and people of color (BIPOC) communities. To adequately identify and
   address these harms, we argue that scientists, practitioners, and
   communities need a transdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple
   types of knowledge, in particular, Indigenous and experiential
   knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems embrace relationality and
   reciprocity rather than extraction and oppression, and experiential
   knowledge grounds transition priorities in lived experiences rather than
   expert assessments. Here, we demonstrate how an Indigenous,
   experiential, and community-based participatory framework for
   understanding and advancing socio-technological system transitions can
   facilitate the co-design and co-development of community-owned energy
   systems.},

Title = {Situation and measures of China's CO2 emission mitigation after the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY},

Volume = {12},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {353-361},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Global response to climate change has entered the phase of full
   implementation of the Paris Agreement. To control the global temperature
   rise below 2 degrees C, all countries must make more efforts to reduce
   emission. China has combined its goal of emission reduction for
   combating climate change with its domestic sustainable development
   strategy to promote energy revolution and the transition of economic
   development to low-carbon patterns. Through reinforcing the commitment
   and action before 2020, the CO2 intensity of GDP can decrease by more
   than 50\% by 2020 compared with that of 2005, and the external
   commitment target of a 40\%-45\% decrease can be over fulfilled.
   Currently, under the new economic normal, China further strengthens the
   policy measure, vigorously saves energy, enhances energy use efficiency
   and the economic output benefit, and simultaneously develops new and
   renewable energy and accelerates energy structural decarbonization, so
   that the annual decrease rate of the CO2 intensity of GDP keeps a high
   level of more than 4\% and remains increasing. Thus, the decrease rate
   of the CO2 intensity of GDP will exceed the GDP growth rate, and then
   CO2 emission will peak around 2030. This will promote the fundamental
   turning of economic development mode, and lay a foundation for the
   establishment of a sustainable energy system with near-zero emissions
   and with new and renewable energy as the main body in the second half of
   this century. China implements the concept of green low-carbon
   development and accelerates the low carbon transition of energy and
   economy to achieve win-win results in economic growth and CO2 emission
   mitigation, and these policies and actions will also provide experiences
   for many other developing countries. On the other hand, China will
   continue to play a positive and constructive leading role in the
   implementation of the Paris Agreement internationally, and promote the
   construction of new mechanisms of win-win cooperation, fairness and
   justice and common development for global climate governance. Moreover,
   China will make an effort to build a community of common destiny for
   mankind, promote pragmatic cooperation among countries, especially among
   developing countries, and take combating climate change as a new
   development opportunity for jointly moving toward climate-friendly
   low-carbon economic development path.},

   consider strategies to support a just transition for regions that depend
   economically on coal exports. However, the role of hydrogen as a part of
   the energy transition has yet to be examined from an environmental
   justice lens. A full-chain life-cycle assessment of hydrogen production
   is yet to be considered in Colombia. Using life-cycle assessment (LCA)
   methodology, we examine the greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption,
   and trace metal emissions associated with six potential Colombian liquid
   hydrogen production strategies: (1) electrolysis powered by the
   country's national electricity grid, (2) on-site electrolysis powered by
   electricity produced by a wind farm, (3) off-site electrolysis powered
   by electricity produced by a wind farm, (4) electrolysis powered by
   electricity produced from a coal-fired power plant, (5) coal
   gasification without carbon capture and storage (CCS), and (6) coal
   gasification with CCS. Upstream conversion has an outsized influence on
   the sustainability of a hydrogen transition in Colombia. Impact levels
   for wind-powered electrolysis are lower than those of the coal- and
   grid-powered scenarios for every impact category analyzed, apart from
   emissions of aluminum to air, nitrogen emissions to water, and
   phosphorous, nitrate, and nitrite emissions to soil. The grid-based
   electrolysis scenario is found to consume the largest amount of water,
   while coal-fueled scenarios pathways raise concerns of greater
   life-cycle mercury, nickel, and arsenic emissions. While coal
   gasification with CCS reduced gasification CO2 emissions by 35\%, the
   CCS scenario's VOC emissions were 37\% greater than gasification without
   CCS, given that increased levels of coal inputs were required to account
   for the loss of efficiency associated with the addition of CCS
   technology. For Colombia to benefit most from a hydrogen-based
   decarbonization transition with minimal environmental impacts,
   community-focused planning and wind-based hydrogen systems should be
   prioritized.},

Abstract = {The deployment of advanced nuclear technologies is anticipated to be
   part of the actions required to mitigate global climate change. The
   successful deployment of these new technologies, like all new

Abstract = {Since export has a key role in economic growth in terms of national
   production quantity, export quality can be considered another important
   factor regarding the revenue from the export product. Hence, both export
   and export quality can contribute to the economic growth process
   positively when the countries' terms of trade have moved in a favorable
   direction from this point of view, it is essential to examine the
   relationship between the energy-growth nexus and export quality.
   Although available seminal studies are monitoring the energy-growth
   nexus, there exists a limited number of works employing the export
   quality. Besides, one might claim that there exists no research on how
   the terms of trade (export quality) alter the economic growth and energy
   use through regime shifts. Markov regime-shifting models estimate (a)
   the impact of export and terms of trade on growth, and (b) the effect of
   growth on the use of fossil energy and renewable energy for the USA at
   regime 1 and regime 2 for the period 1980:Q4-2019:Q2. After conducting
   the non-linear analyses, this paper (i) reveals the estimated parameters
   varying from one regime to another regime through transition
   probabilities, (ii) finds evidence that (a) export and export quality
   growths affect positively GDP growth, (b) GDP growth increases fossil
   fuel consumption growth, (c) renewable energy growth increases at
   decreasing rate due to GDP growth, and (iii) yields relevant
   energy-environmental policy proposals by underlying the prominence of
   terms of trade within growth-energy nexus.},

Title = {Squaring the sunny circle? On balancing distributive justice of power
   grid costs and incentives for solar prosumers},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {173-188},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Solar prosumers are about to revolutionize the power sector. Utilities
   are challenged in recovering the costs of distribution grids, as parts
   of their revenue basis decreases through self-consumption. Adjusting the
   grid tariff sets off a reinforcing feedback loop that increases the
   attractiveness of solar investments, but also leads to a distribution
   effect between solar prosumers and conventional consumers. The question
   is: How to recover distribution grid costs equitable without hampering
   the diffusion of solar power? Can the two criteria be fulfilled at the
   same time, or is do we aim for squaring a circle? To address this
   question, I present a System Dynamics simulation model designed to
   understand the interactions and assess these competing goals. The
   occurring distribution effect under the volumetric grid tariff with net
   purchase and sale appears to be rather limited. Simulation experiments
   reveal that grid tariff designs strongly influence investments for solar
   power. A capacity tariff can reduce deviations from the cost causation
   principle of solar prosumers and incentivizes investments in
   decentralized storage solutions to reduce peak demand. Nevertheless,
   also the capacity tariff causes a distribution effect.},

Title = {Comparison of 1A GeV Au-197+C data with thermodynamics: The nature of
   the phase transition in nuclear multifragmentation},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW C},
Year = {2001},

Number = {5},

Abstract = {Multifragmentation MF results from 1A GeV Au on C have been compared
   with the Copenhagen statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). The
   complete charge, mass, and momentum reconstruction of the Au projectile
   was used to identify high momentum ejectiles leaving an excited remnant
   of mass A, charge Z, and excitation energy E{*} which subsequently
   multifragments. Measurement of the magnitude and multiplicity (energy)
   dependence of the initial free volume and the breakup volume determines
   the variable volume parametrization of SMM. Very good agreement is
   obtained using SMM with the standard values of the SMM parameters. A
   large number of observables, including the fragment charge yield
   distributions, fragment multiplicity distributions, caloric curve,
   critical exponents, and the critical scaling function are explored in
   this comparison. The two stage structure of SMM is used to determine the
   effect of cooling of the primary hot fragments. Average fragment yields
   with Z greater than or equal to3 are essentially unaffected when the
   excitation energy is less than or equal to7 MeV/nucleon. SMM studies
   suggest that the experimental critical exponents are largely unaffected
   by cooling and event mixing. The nature of the phase transition in SMM
   is studied as a function of the remnant mass and charge using the
   microcanonical equation of state. For light remnants A less than or
   equal to 100, backbending is observed indicating negative specific heat,
   while for A less than or equal to 170 the effective latent heat
   approaches zero. Thus for heavier systems this transition can be
   identified as a continuous thermal phase transition where a large
   nucleus breaks up into a number of smaller nuclei with only a minimal
   release of constituent nucleons. Z less than or equal to2 particles are
   primarily emitted in the initial collision and after MF in the fragment
   deexcitation process.},

Title = {Far from optimal? Exploring the normative premises and politics of
   carbon pricing},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite its limited effectiveness to date, economists continue to claim
   that carbon pricing is optimal for climate policy. As climate policy
   becomes more urgent, it is crucial to understand whether this optimality
   claim holds. We show how optimality is contingent upon normative
   premises of what constitutes well-being and politics. The optimality
   claim can only be sustained if well-being is conceptualized as
   preference satisfaction and politics is narrowly understood as the
   sphere within which social conflicts are resolved via efficient resource
   allocation. Both premises are contested, however. If well-being is
   understood as human need satisfaction, sustainable consumption corridors
   can be conceived as optimal. Alternative understandings of politics
   imply that carbon pricing requires revenue redistribution or an
   embedding in deliberative processes to become optimal, or might not be
   optimal at all. Based on the conceptual strengths of alternative views
   of well-being and politics, we illuminate blind spots in the theoretical
   case for carbon pricing. At the policy level, carbon pricing overlooks
   qualitative differences in economic production and the systemic nature
   of fossil fuel dependence. It bears little relation to the Earth's
   biophysical limits or social justice. At the level of politics, focusing
   on carbon pricing fails to provide procedures beyond the market to
   address social conflicts. In particular, from a radical democratic view,
   carbon pricing represents a sustainability fix which stabilizes the
   fossil economy. Sustainable consumption corridors are in a much better
   position to re-politicize and ultimately deconstruct the hegemony of the
   fossil economy.},

Title = {Multifragmentation and the phase transition: A systematic study of the
   multifragmentation of 1A GeVAu, La, and Kr},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW C},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {65},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A systematic analysis of multifragmentation (MF) in fully reconstructed
   events from 1A GeV Au, La, and Kr collisions with C has been performed.
   These data are used to provide a definitive test of the variable volume
   version of the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). A single set
   of SMM parameters directly determined by the data and the semi-empirical
   mass formula are used after the adjustable inverse level density
   parameter epsilon(0) is determined by the fragment distributions. The
   results from SMM for second stage multiplicity, size of the biggest
   fragment, and the intermediate mass fragments are in excellent agreement
   with the data. Multifragmentation thresholds have been obtained for all
   three systems using SMM prior to secondary decay. The data indicate that
   both thermal excitation energy E-th{*} and the isotope ratio temperature
   THe-DT decrease with increase in system size at the critical point. The
   breakup temperature obtained from SMM also shows the same trend as seen
   in the data. The SMM model is used to study the nature of the MF phase
   transition. The caloric curve for Kr exhibits back-bending (finite
   latent heat) while the caloric curves for Au and La are consistent with
   a continuous phase transition (nearly zero latent heat) and the values
   of the critical exponents tau, beta, and gamma, both from data and SMM,
   are close to those for a ``liquid-gas{''} system for Au and La. We
   conclude that the larger Coulomb expansion energy in Au and La reduces
   the latent heat required for MF and changes the nature of the phase
   transition. Thus the Coulomb energy plays a major role in nuclear MF.},

Title = {California oil: Bridging the gaps between local decision-making and

Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1354-1359},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {California has set ambitious climate policies, including economy-wide
   carbon neutrality by 2045. Yet levels of oil production and consumption
   remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and
   its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making
   processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning
   decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint
   article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon
   oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were
   withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry
   volatility and public opposition - rather than state regulations - that
   have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state
   climate goals. As California pursues a goal of `managing the decline' of
   domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps
   between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including:
   a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects;
   a 2,500 ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation
   schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil
   surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such
   changes - particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the
   growing problem of well decommissioning.},

Abstract = {Despite the wide array of Environmental Trust Funds (ETFs) created and
   utilized globally, limited information is available on the
   characteristics that make such funds successful, particularly as they
   relate to the experiences of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This
   study evaluates the Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) of the Maldives as
   a case in point. Experiences from the energy component of the CCTF
   indicate that while technology transfer is needed, the project approach
   did not help to overcome the lack of human resource capacity to manage
   the transition to renewable energy in Thinadhoo. A comparison of the
   CCTF with Bhutan's experience suggests that instead of implementing
   projects directly by the ETF, as done by CCTF, it would be more suitable
   for an organization to facilitate the implementation. In addition to
   having a fund, stakeholder participation, institutional development, and
   focusing on broader goals with co-benefits from projects would increase
   the prospect of success for ETFs.},

Abstract = {High energy (C and D) excitons possess extraordinary influence over the
   optical properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides
   (TMDCs), and the comprehensive understanding of these would play a
   pivotal role in advancing research on 2D optoelectronics. Herein, we
   employed transient absorption spectroscopy to monitor the underlying
   photophysical processes involved with different excitonic features in
   few layer WS2, modeled as a TMDC representative. We observed a strong
   intervalley coupling across the momentum space and proposed the most
   plausible relaxation pathway for different excitons in few layer
   scenario. C and D exciton dynamics were significantly slower as compared
   to canonical A and B excitons, as a consequence of the indirect
   Lambda-Gamma relaxation in C and D and direct K-K combination in A and
   B. Most importantly, all four excitons emerge in the system and
   influence each other irrespective of the incident photon energy, which
   would be extremely impactful in fabricating wide range photonic devices.},

   Chinese built Bui dam in Ghana},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {499-507},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The literature on technology transfer has focussed on North-South
   transfer and has analysed transfer as a largely technical process. This
   is despite the increasing influence of rising powers in technology
   transfer, specifically in the area of energy generation. China is an
   important player in this field. This article has two aims: firstly, it
   adds to the small but emerging literature on South-South technology
   transfer by exploring the role of Chinese actors, using the Bui dam in
   Ghana as a case study. Secondly, the article develops an expanded notion
   of technology transfer by arguing that technology transfer is not only a
   technical process, but it is inherently political as it includes crucial
   issues on decision-making regarding the type of technology that is
   transferred, who is granted access to the decision-making process, and
   who benefits from the new technology. In examining technology transfer
   from this perspective, the article draws on the sociology of
   technologies approach and the sustainable transitions literature arguing
   that technology transfer is a contested process that takes place within
   complex political, economic, social and cultural settings and actor
   networks. This determines the technology that is transferred, who
   benefits most, and who is marginalized in the process.},

Abstract = {Interventions in the clean cooking sector have focused on improved
   biomass stoves in a bid to address household air pollution (HAP) in low-
   and middle-income countries. These initiatives have not delivered
   adequate health and environmental benefits owing to the less than
   optimal performance of improved biomass stoves. There is an urgency to
   transition communities to cleaner cooking systems such as liquefied
   petroleum gas (LPG) to reduce the prevalence of HAP. Adoption of LPG
   also has challenges. This case-control cross-sectional study with 510
   households examines how affordability, accessibility, and awareness
   (3As) are associated with LPG adoption in rural poor households of
   Andhra Pradesh, a state of India. Using binomial logistic regression
   analyses, the study examines the association of 3As with LPG adoption,
   adjusting for demographic predictors. Results show disparities in LPG
   adoption owing to affordability, accessibility, and awareness. Household
   income is positively associated with LPG adoption. Easy availability of
   biomass deters households from adopting LPG. Concerns for LPG safety
   reduces likelihood of LPG adoption. On the other hand, attending
   awareness campaigns on clean cooking benefits is strongly associated
   with LPG adoption. Awareness drives, primarily targeted marketing
   campaigns, could help expand LPG coverage among poorer households. This
   paper offers insights into the determinants of clean fuel adoption with
   implications for resource-poor settings across the world to advance
   energy justice and address energy poverty.},

Title = {The socio-spatial politics of royalties and their distribution: A case
   study of the Surat Basin, Queensland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE},
Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the socio-spatial and ethical politics of
   redistribution, specifically the allocation of natural resources rents
   from political and economic cores to the economic and geographical
   peripheries whence the resource originated. Based on a case study of the
   coal seam gas sector in Queensland's Surat Basin, this paper focuses on
   the operation of the Queensland State Government's regional development
   fund for mining and energy extraction-affected regions. Employing an
   environmental justice framework, we critically explore the operation of
   these funds in ostensibly helping constituent communities in becoming
   resilient to the worst effects of the `staples trap'. Drawing on
   secondary demographic and housing data for the region, as well as
   primary information collected from key respondents from mid-2018 to
   early 2019, we show that funds were distributed across all of the local
   government areas, and allocated to projects and places primarily on a
   perceived economic needs basis. However, concerns were raised with the
   probity of the funds' administration. In terms of recognition justice,
   the participation of smaller and more remote towns and local Indigenous
   communities was hampered by their structural marginalisation.
   Procedurally, the funds were criticised for the lack of local
   consultation taken in the development and approval of projects. While
   spatially concentrated expenditure may be the most cost-effective use of
   public monies, we argue that grant application processes should be open,
   transparent and inclusive, and the outcomes cognisant of the
   developmental needs of smaller communities, together with the need to
   foster regional solidarity and coherence.},

Title = {Friends with benefits: How income and peer diffusion combine to create
   an inequality ``trap{''} in the uptake of low-carbon technologies},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {What drives inequalities in the uptake of low-carbon energy
   technologies? Research has shown that people on higher incomes are
   significantly more likely to access and benefit from policies designed
   to boost uptake of clean energy technologies than those with lower
   incomes, revealing a pervasive inequality issue. Yet little is known
   about how these inequalities evolve or interact with factors beyond
   income alone, understanding of which is crucial to designing policies
   which do not simply replicate or exacerbate existing inequalities going
   forward. This paper thus advances the novel ``feed-in-tariff trap{''}
   theory, which posits that, rather than income alone, peer diffusion and
   socioeconomic factors compound to widen inequalities in the uptake of
   low-carbon technologies over time. Using a combination of mixed effects
   and piecewise structural equation modelling, this theory is tested on
   the adoption of 21,206 household-level wind and solar PV installations
   across 6976 micro-level data-zones in Scotland between 2009 and 2020
   under the UK government feed-in-tariff. It finds crucially that: (1)
   household solar PV and wind are adopted consistently in higher-income
   areas, (2) peer diffusion is strongest in higher income areas with high
   early adoption rates, and (3) socioeconomic conditions are extremely
   temporally stub-born. Combined, this trifecta creates an inequality
   ``trap{''}, locking the benefits of low-carbon technology subsidies into
   the same higher income areas and widening the gap in uptake between more
   affluent and deprived com-munities as a result. Recommendations are
   given on how best to address this, with implications for anyone
   concerned with a ``just{''} transition going forward.},

Title = {Contesting the `greening' of hydropower in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The 21st century has witnessed a resurgence of hydropower projects
   across the globe, with the energy source an integral part of
   contemporary sustainable energy transitions. Yet, the environmentalist
   credentials of hydropower remain contested by anti-dam movements. This
   paper details the cases of the Belo Monte and Sao Luiz do TapajOs dams
   in the Brazilian Amazon to explore how the development, submission and
   acceptance of an Environmental Impact Assessment provides a key site in
   the contestation of hydroelectric projects. Whilst the provision of this
   document - and the wider environmental licensing process - represents a
   key component in the asserted `green-ness' of hydropower, opposition
   groups extend the scope of analysis to include indirect and cumulative
   impacts that remain understudied in official assessments. This paper
   analyses interviews and questionnaires with and documents provided by
   national and international civil society organisations to trace this
   process of challenge and critique. It details how civil society actors
   forward alternative assessments of the impacts of the projects studied,
   uncovering and illuminating overlooked and understudied externalities of
   hydropower in the Brazilian Amazon. An analysis of this process not only
   demonstrates that the `green' credentials of hydropower remain far from
   assured but also highlights how anti-dam actors advance new
   `sustainabilities' to discredit the terrain upon which such credentials
   are set.},

Title = {Low-Carbon Gentrification: When Climate Change Encounters Residential

Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {5},
Pages = {845-863},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the emergence of low-carbon' gentrification as a
   distinct urban phenomenon, a process that we see as the outcome of
   efforts to change the social and spatial composition of urban districts
   under the pretext of responding to climate change and energy efficiency
   imperatives. The article develops a conceptual framework for
   scrutinizing low-carbon gentrification, predicated upon insights from
   literatures on ecological gentrification and displacement. It documents
   the existence of an eco-social paradox' associated with new patterns of
   socio-spatial segregation and energy efficiency retrofits. We
   interrogate the discursive and policy frameworks, socio-spatial
   implications and political contestations of low-carbon gentrification.
   Evidence is drawn from case study research in an inner-city district of
   the Polish city of Gdask, where such processes have been unfolding since
   2006 due to the implementation of a targeted urban regeneration
   programme. This investigation is positioned within a wider analysis of
   secondary written sources about similar developments in other
   geographical contexts across Europe and North America, where anecdotal
   evidence suggests that low-carbon gentrification may be widespread and
   common.},

Abstract = {The impact of restricted access to sustainable energy is the worst in
   vulnerable urban poor areas, and so an alternative approach to energy
   innovations is needed. To explore the possibilities for energy
   innovations, gender needs to be taken into account. This is especially
   relevant in the sub-Saharan African context, as most households are
   female-headed. This paper aims to explore the current state of gendered
   energy innovations by using a multivocal approach; it thus focuses on
   the existing body of knowledge at the gender-energy interface. The study
   is conducted in two parts: first, `state of the art' is conceptualised
   using a multilevel approach; second, a structured literature review on
   gendered energy innovations is conducted in light of the structured
   understanding of `state of the art'. There is definitely room for new
   innovations to use gender as a strategy for solving energy security
   problems in urban poor environments.},

Title = {<p>Assessment of the greenhouse gas, Episodic air quality and public
   health benefits of fuel cell electrification of a major port complex \&
   nbsp;</p>},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Communities located adjacent to goods movement hubs (such as major
   ports) experience degraded air quality (AQ) because of emissions from
   on-road and off-road diesel equipment, including heavy-duty diesel
   trucks (HDDT), cargo, and materials handling equipment (CHE), ships, and
   rail technologies. In response, California is pursuing transitions to
   efficient and cleaner freight systems by introducing zero-emission
   technologies as the alternative to conventional technologies. Equipment
   and vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells represent a potential
   zero-emissions pathway for freight technologies at ports, including
   HDDT, CHE, ships, and rail applications, referred to collectively as
   fuel cell electric technologies (FCET). This work is the first to assess
   the AQ and human health impacts of deploying FCET to provide goods
   movement services at ports. Specific focus is given to southern
   California due to existing AQ challenges and the presence of significant
   activity from the San Pedro Bay Port Complex, which includes the Ports
   of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Sets of future vehicle and equipment
   cases are developed spanning a range of FCET penetrations and assessed
   to quantify how FCET provides improvements in primary and secondary
   pollutant concentrations and the value of corresponding public health
   benefits. If fuel cells are used in all technologies considered, the
   results show significant improvements in maximum 8-h ozone (-2.69 ppb
   to-5.09 ppb) and maximum 24-h PM2.5 (-0.59 mu g/m(3) to -2.57 mu g/m(3))
   can be achieved with FCET deployment, and the valuation of health
   benefits is estimated to range from \$3.21 to \$7.11 million per day
   depending on the level of penetration reached in each technology
   category. Reducing emissions from ships and HDDT is found to attain the
   highest health savings. Heightening the importance of these benefits,
   socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are found to experience
   larger health savings from FCET deployment in contrast to the population
   as a whole. As a co-benefit, FCET deployment is shown to result in
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions which will further increase
   with the sourcing of hydrogen from renewable sources. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of addressing environmental quality
   associated with the goods movement sector in urban areas and validate
   support of zero-emission projects through incentives and other policy
   mechanisms. Furthermore, policies designed to support zero-emission
   strategies within HDDT and ships powered by renewable fuels represent a
   promising pathway for air quality and GHG co-benefits.\& nbsp;},

Abstract = {We report the observation of the enhancement of a transverse optical
   (TO) phonon mode of e(1) symmetry and a normally forbidden surface
   optical (SO) phonon mode of b(1) symmetry in CdSe quantum dots (QDs) due
   to adsorption of 4-mercaptopyridine molecules. The former is observed in
   3, 4, and 5 nm diameter particles, while the latter is observed only in
   the 2 nm particles. Maximum enhancement of the phonon modes is obtained
   through a coupling of the charge-transfer transition and the exciton
   transition which are in resonance with the laser energy. Selection rules
   using Herzberg Teller (vibronic) coupling are invoked to explain the
   observed enhancements.},

Title = {Circular economy-induced global employment shifts in apparel value
   chains: Job reduction in apparel production activities, job growth in
   reuse and recycling activities},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There is no evidence-based discussion on the intended and unintended
   global social impacts, such as changes in employment, of the European
   Union's (EU) transition towards the Circular Economy (CE). Consequently,
   its ethical implications are nebulous. Therefore, this paper assesses
   CE-induced global employment shifts using the example of the apparel
   value chains of apparel imported to the EU from the top five exporting
   countries: China, Bangladesh, India, Turkey and Cambodia. The discussion
   of the results is based on the ethical framework for global
   transformative change that applies justice considerations on
   sustainability transitions. This paper is the first sector-specific
   quantitative study on the employment effects of the EU transition on a
   global scale, including ethical dimensions of those effects, as far as
   we are aware. Overall, this paper contributes to the broader discussion
   of CE-induced social effects of sustainability transitions. Its results
   indicate that employment could significantly decrease in low- to
   upper-middle-income countries outside the EU, in particular in
   labour-intense apparel production. Employment could increase in
   less-labour intense downstream reuse and recycling activities in the EU
   and second-hand retail in- and outside the EU. From an ethical
   perspective, the benefits and disadvantages of the circular transition
   seem to be unevenly distributed, with the main adverse effects to be
   carried by non-EU stakeholders.},

Title = {Environmental conflicts and defenders: A global overview},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recent research and policies recognize the importance of environmental
   defenders for global sustainability and emphasize their need for
   protection against violence and repression. However, effective support
   may benefit from a more systematic understanding of the underlying
   environmental conflicts, as well as from better knowledge on the factors
   that enable environmental defenders to mobilize successfully. We have
   created the global Environmental Justice Atlas to address this knowledge
   gap. Here we present a large-n analysis of 2743 cases that sheds light
   on the characteristics of environmental conflicts and the environmental
   defenders involved, as well as on successful mobilization strategies. We
   find that bottom-up mobilizations for more sustainable and socially just
   uses of the environment occur worldwide across all income groups,
   testifying to the global existence of various forms of grassroots
   environmentalism as a promising force for sustainability. Environmental
   defenders are frequently members of vulnerable groups who employ largely
   non-violent protest forms. In 11\% of cases globally, they contributed
   to halt environmentally destructive and socially conflictive projects,
   defending the environment and livelihoods. Combining strategies of
   preventive mobilization, protest diversification and litigation can
   increase this success rate significantly to up to 27\%. However,
   defenders face globally also high rates of criminalization (20\% of
   cases), physical violence (18\%), and assassinations (13\%), which
   significantly increase when Indigenous people are involved. Our results
   call for targeted actions to enhance the conditions enabling successful
   mobilizations, and for specific support for Indigenous environmental
   defenders.},

Title = {Can Pay-As-You-Go, Digitally Enabled Business Models Support
   Sustainability Transformations in Developing Countries? Outstanding
   Questions and a Theoretical Basis for Future Research},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper examines the rapidly emerging and rapidly changing phenomenon
   of pay-as-you-go (PAYG), digitally enabled business models, which have
   had significant early success in providing poor people with access to
   technologies relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (e.g.,
   for electricity access, water and sanitation, and agricultural
   irrigation). Data are analysed based on literature review, two
   stakeholder workshops (or transformation labs), and stakeholder
   interviews (engaging 41 stakeholders in total). This demonstrates the
   existing literature on PAYG is patchy at best, with no comprehensive or
   longitudinal, and very little theoretically grounded, research to date.
   The paper contributes to existing research on PAYG, and sustainability
   transformations more broadly, in two key ways. Firstly, it articulates a
   range of questions that remain to be answered in order to understand and
   deliver against the current and potential contribution of PAYG in
   affecting sustainability transformations (the latter we define as
   achieving environmental sustainability and social justice). These
   questions focus at three levels: national contexts for fostering
   innovation and technology uptake, the daily lives of poor and
   marginalised women and men, and global political economies and value
   accumulation. Secondly, the paper articulates three areas of theory
   (based on emerging critical social science research on sustainable
   energy access) that have potential to support future research that might
   answer these questions, namely: socio-technical innovation
   system-building, social practice, and global political economy and value
   chain analysis. Whilst recognising existing tensions between these three
   areas of theory, we argue that rapid sustainability transformations
   demand a level of epistemic pragmatism. Such pragmatism, we argue, can
   be achieved by situating research using any of the above areas of theory
   within the broader context of Leach et al.'s (2010) Pathways Approach.
   This allows for exactly the kind of interdisciplinary approach, based on
   a commitment to pluralism and the co-production of knowledge, and firmly
   rooted commitment to environmental sustainability and social justice
   that the SDGs demand.},

Abstract = {Energy spectra of hydrogen and helium isotopes emitted in Au+Au
   collisions at 0.25, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.0, and 1.15A GeV have been
   measured. A systematic study of the shapes of the spectra reveals a
   significant non-thermal component consistent with collective radial
   flow. The strength of this component is evaluated as a function of
   bombarding energy. Comparisons of the flow signal to predictions of QMD
   and BUU models are made. Using reverse kinematics, breakup of gold
   nuclei has been studied in Au+C reactions at 1.0A GeV. The moments of
   the resulting charged fragment distribution provide evidence that
   nuclear matter possesses a critical point observable in finite nuclei.
   Values for the critical exponents gamma, beta, and tau have been
   determined. These values are close to those for liquid-gas systems and
   different from those for 3D percolation.},

Abstract = {Wind energy plays a key role in the transition to a low-carbon European
   energy system. The implementation of European and national targets for
   wind energy expansion is, however, challenged by technical,
   environmental, economic and social acceptance aspects. Further research
   on wind power expansion is compelled due to dynamic aspects such as
   land-use fluctuations, evolution of wind turbine technology, associated
   cost, and other factors. For that reason, a systematic approach for
   exploring future scenarios of onshore wind power development under
   techno-economic aspects and quantitative aspects of social acceptance
   (distributive justice and regulatory framework) was developed. The model
   was developed in Python, PostgreSQL and SQliteDB and encompasses a
   high-resolution GIS-based assessment of potential locations for wind
   turbines. Homogenous input data allows for analysing the wind power
   potential across Europe. Poland was chosen as a case study to examine
   the impact of the distance regulation introduced in 2016 and its
   subsequent amendments, which are relevant for onshore wind power
   development foreseen in the EU reference scenario 2016 for 2030. The
   findings show that Poland can reach the target of 10.3 GW set by the EU
   scenario at Levelized Cost of Electricity below (sic)60/MWh. The
   transparent modelling framework and findings can support the decision
   making process on wind energy expansion, which is in the hands of policy
   makers, private investors and local citizens.},

Title = {Equitable Community Solar: California \& Beyond},
Journal = {ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1017-1047},
Abstract = {Residential solar and utility scale solar are low-hanging fruit in the
   renewables transition, but targeting low-hanging fruit can only go so
   far. Can states innovate, reach further, and ignite near-universal
   consumer demand for clean energy and achieve social justice goals
   through equitable community solar?
   For the last decade, the goal of mitigating climate change primarily
   drove the transition to renewable energy in states and countries that
   took the climate change crisis seriously. But there is even greater
   promise. The shift to renewable energy holds the transformative
   potential for broader social benefits, such as wealth-building
   opportunities, good jobs, health improvements, energy bill savings, and
   resilience in the face of power outages. Manifesting this potential
   requires intentional policy. Unfortunately, even in California, a state
   determined to lead the transition to renewable energy, the
   implementation of climate action is poised for inequitable disparities.
   Although advocates saw community solar-cooperatively generating solar
   energy-as an avenue for all communities to benefit from the energy
   transition, the state poorly designed its first community solar policy,
   and the program has been a failure. California is now embarking on a
   significantly smaller second attempt at community solar targeted at
   serving disadvantaged communities: the Community Solar Green Tariff. But
   has the state learned from its first failure? This Article analyzes
   California's new community solar program and proposes a framework for
   ``equitable community solar{''} to improve program design, in hopes that
   other states learn from where the Golden State has stumbled.},

Abstract = {Green economy is a concept frequently used by governments and
   international institutions to promote sustainable transformations of the
   economy. In this study, we explore how the transition towards a green
   economy is being conceptualised in policy terms in the three Nordic
   countries Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Comparing these cases, we analyse
   strategic policy documents on green growth, circular economy,
   bioeconomy, low-carbon transitions, and sustainable development. While
   comprehensive national policy strategies on the green economy are
   lacking, the studied documents display policy approaches that reflect
   different aspects of a green economic transformations, such as
   low-carbon developments, promotion of environmental technology sectors,
   and enhanced circularity. Our findings indicate the presence of a
   transformative Nordic model for greening the economy, in which the state
   plays an active role in supporting innovation and technology
   development, facilitating cooperation among societal actors, and
   securing social welfare and human wellbeing. It is underpinned by
   optimism about the opportunity to reconcile economic growth with
   sustainable development, while more radical beyond growth approaches are
   strikingly absent, reflecting their marginal roles in the established
   policy discourse of these countries. Rather, concepts such as circular
   economy, sharing economy, and sustainable production and consumption are
   highlighted as central for greening the economy.},

Title = {An empirico-legal analytical and design model for local microgrids:
   applying the ILTIAD' model, combining the IAD-framework with
   institutional legal theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {479-506},
Abstract = {This article presents a new framework for the analysis and design of
   legal-governance settings for collective action challenges, particularly
   of local (smart) microgrids, with a focus on related local planning. The
   framework connects Ostrom's IAD-Framework with Institutional Legal
   Theory (ILT), to foster proper understanding of both empirical and
   legal-prescriptive elements. This is relevant to state of affairs
   analyses, but also to design-oriented analysis towards institutional
   change of legal settings for local smart microgrid systems. The proposed
   framework connection (named `ILTIAD') contributes to a proper
   empirico-legal understanding of existing and possible improvements in
   public-private arrangements relevant to bring about innovations of the
   said local microgrids. A three-step conceptual approach is presented.
   The first step is about relating local smart microgrids to the concept
   of a collective action and explaining the relevance of adding an ILT
   perspective to the IAD-framework. The second step is to frame the
   connection between IAD and ILT (as ILTIAD) with a view on relevant
   action situations. To this end, Ostrom's `rules-in-use' are connected to
   legal `rules-inform'. This institutional rule-perspective is then
   aligned with action situations at Ostrom's four analytical levels,
   considering that different legal institutions are relevant to the
   content of action situation rules. In the third step, the institutional
   rule-perspective is placed in the specific legal setting of an example
   for a Dutch Crown Decree on experiments for decentralized renewable
   energy projects. We demonstrate how the abstract ILTIAD-framework
   provides a lens to identify legal aspects as constraints and
   opportunities within action situations. Furthermore, we show from a
   design perspective how the framework can help identify gaps and
   conflicts when establishing and maintaining particular local smart
   microgrids. In doing so, we also connect to dynamic aspects of
   underlying transition justice concerns, following energy expansion
   versus energy democratisation frames. In conclusion the article reflects
   inter alia on some analytical and methodological aspects of ILTIAD as
   compared to the IAD-framework.},

Title = {Sustainability of Low Carbon City Initiatives in China: A Comprehensive
   Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Low carbon city (LCC) has emerged as the latest sustainable urbanism
   strategy in China as a response to climate change impacts. Yet, minimal
   scholarships have explored the sustainability of the urban planning
   model towards understanding the complexity of the components. Using a
   two-step triangulation approach, this paper presents a structured
   overview of the LCC initiative in China as it relates to the transition
   to a sustainability paradigm. The data collection approach includes a
   comprehensive review of 238 articles on LCC to identify and categorize
   LCC components. Furthermore, discourse and framing analysis was used to
   develop and synthesize a conceptual framework for assimilating the
   components into four core sustainable development principles:
   Integration, implementation, equity, and scalability and replicability.
   The results indicate that LCC development in China is bias towards
   economic and environmental technological innovations and strategies.
   Additionally, several critical sustainability issues of LCC pilots were
   identified. These include a lack of social equity planning concerns for
   the most vulnerable population, dearth of social reforms that cater to
   lifestyle and behavioral change, top-down planning and decision-making
   processes, a technocratic rationalization planning approach,
   inconsistent LCC targets on inter-generational justice concerns, absence
   of an effective national ``sharing and learning{''} city-city network
   system, and several barriers to implementation. We conclude that the
   applied theoretical and conceptual inquiry into the field of LCC is
   pertinent to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable urban
   development.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {6},
Pages = {477-485},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background/aimHistorically occupational therapy has evidenced a tenacity
   to adjust and adapt to societal changes. Currently in Australia we are
   in the midst of significant change in health, disability and aged care
   service delivery alongside increasing numbers of new graduates seeking
   employment. Both of these changes create challenges and opportunities
   for the profession. How the profession adjusts to new service delivery
   models and supports new graduates in this changing work environment will
   influence our future.
   MethodsUsing examples from practice the paper explores ways in which
   partnership, inclusion and innovation can be effective in a changing
   environment.
   ResultsDoing effective partnership takes time, energy and a shared
   commitment of all involved and often requires negotiations and
   compromise. Inclusion can be tricky and requires vigilance and ongoing
   reflection on actions to determine if the outcomes are what was
   intended. Innovation can play two roles; it can be used to conserve
   current practice in new ways or it can offer agency to disrupt and
   redefine practice.
   ConclusionThe way in which the profession chooses to enact partnerships
   and inclusion will play a vital role in shaping the future. Similarly
   the space and support made for conservative or disruptive innovation
   will determine how we choose to define ourselves going forward.
   Moreover, these choices and actions will govern how effective we are in
   navigating the changing environment and supporting new graduates
   transitioning into the profession.},

Title = {Which decreases in air pollution should be targeted to bring health and
   economic benefits and improve environmental justice?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {538-550},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure entails large
   health effects in many urban areas. Public measures aiming at decreasing
   air pollution are often designed without targeting an explicit health
   benefit. Our objective was to investigate the health and economic
   benefits and the social inequalities in exposure resulting from several
   scenarios of reduction of PM2.5 exposure, in order to support decisions
   about urban policies.
   Material and methods: In the French conurbations of Grenoble and Lyon
   (0.4 and 1.4 million inhabitants, respectively), PM2.5 yearly average
   exposure was estimated on a 10-m grid by coupling a PM2.5 dispersion
   model to population density. Changes in death cases, life expectancy,
   lung cancer and term low birth weight incident cases as well as
   associated health economic costs were estimated for ten PM2.5 reduction
   scenarios differing in terms of amplitude of reduction and spatial
   extent. Changes in social differences in PM2.5 exposure were also
   assessed.
   Results: During the 2015-2017 period, PM2.5 average exposure was 13.9 mu
   g/m(3) in Grenoble and 15.3 mu g/m(3) in Lyon conurbations. Exposure to
   PM2.5 led to an estimated 145 (95\% Confidence Interval, CI, 90-199) and
   531 (95\% CI, 330-729) premature deaths, 16 (95\% CI, 8-24) and 65 (95\%
   CI, 30-96) incident lung cancers, and 49 (95\% CI, 19-76) and 193 (95\%
   CI, 76-295) term low birth weight cases each year in Grenoble and Lyon
   conurbations, respectively, compared to a situation without PM2.5
   anthropogenic sources, i.e. a PM2.5 concentration of 4.9 mu g/m(3). The
   associated costs amounted to 495 (Grenoble) and 1767 (Lyon) M(sic)/year
   for the intangible costs related to all-cause non-accidental mortality
   and 27 and 105 M(sic) for the tangible and intangible costs induced by
   lung cancer. A PM2.5 exposure reduction down to the WHO air quality
   guideline (10 mu g/m(3)) would reduce anthropogenic PM2.5-attributable
   mortality by half while decreases by 2.9 mu g/m(3) (Grenoble) and 3.3 mu
   g/m(3) (Lyon) were required to reduce it by a third. Scenarios focusing
   only on the most exposed areas had little overall impact. Scenarios
   seeking to reach a homogeneous exposure in the whole study area were the
   most efficient in alleviating social inequalities in exposure.
   Conclusions: Reduction scenarios targeting only air pollution hotspots
   had lithe expected impact on population health. We provided estimates of
   the PM2.5 change required to reduce PM2.5-attributable mortality by one
   third or more. Our approach can help targeting air pollution reduction
   scenarios expected to entail significant benefits, and it could easily
   be transposed to other urban areas.},

   `practice-consensus') in early processes of `niche' innovations. In
   doing so, insights are offered into how maverick experimentation and

Title = {Environment-related stranded assets: An agenda for research into value
   destruction within carbon-intensive sectors in response to environmental
   concerns},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper maps the research on environment-related stranded assets. It
   finds that the stranded assets field emerged due to the uptake of carbon
   budget concept by business and policy research and growing concerns over
   the knock-on effects of massive value destruction within the fossil fuel
   industry. The field then evolved into six research streams: unburnable
   carbon; the scale of stranded assets; stranded assets and financial
   markets; recognition of stranded assets; divestment; stranded assets and
   carbon lock-in effect in energy infrastructure. Key findings are as
   follows. First, the research into stranded assets is relatively narrow
   in scope; a sectoral and geographical imbalance is evident in the
   literature. Second, stranded assets are mostly discussed in grey
   literature with little connection to work in other research domains.
   Third, the existing literature has a strong focus on highlighting the
   magnitude of the stranded assets problem; however, its implications for
   climate-sensitive sectors have received little consideration. Fourth,
   the stranded assets research has mostly focused on calculating the
   cumulative amount of assets that may become stranded in the long term.
   Fifth, a disconnect between value destruction and value creation aspects
   of the transition to a low-carbon economy may be present. Sixth, there
   seems to be a dearth of empirical studies to answer many questions about
   the market implications of stranded assets, particularly in the energy
   sector. Therefore, more advanced studies are needed to develop a deeper
   understanding of macro-and microeconomic impacts of stranded assets
   which is a promising avenue for further research.},

Title = {The urban material politics of decarbonization in Stockholm, London and
   San Francisco},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {106-115},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the implementation of carbon governance initiatives
   targeting urban buildings and energy infrastructure and uses a material
   politics approach to evaluate whether these practices are triggering
   trajectories towards decarbonization. Urban low carbon transitions
   suggest a substantial re-ordering of urban infrastructure. However,
   there is a critical need to engage with the material implications of low
   carbon practices since research so far has painted a picture of
   incremental ambitions struggling in implementation. This paper
   interrogates how carbon governance is implemented through urban
   buildings and energy systems, and the implications for urban
   decarbonization, by drawing on three urban case studies: Stockholm,
   London and San Francisco. The analysis draws on interviews with
   representatives from government, industry, utilities, building owners,
   and non-governmental organizations who are striving to achieve
   decarbonization in their cities. Patterns are emerging in what is being
   made to matter politically through the translation of carbon governance
   into building-energy infrastructure. In particular, the paper finds that
   (1) a short-term decision making timeline encourages action that
   incrementally reduces greenhouse gas emissions without fundamentally
   overcoming carbon lock-in, (2) actors are harnessing exceptional urban
   space to overcome the tyranny of cost-effectiveness in maintaining
   fossil fuel entrenchment (with concerning implications for justice and
   uneven development), (3) there is a pattern of individualization of
   responsibility for decarbonization, and (4) material politics are
   limiting the application of low carbon retrofits for the existing built
   form. Overall, this paper examines the implementation of urban carbon
   governance while encompassing the messy, materially embedded, and
   contested nature of infrastructure transformations.},

Title = {Tales of transforming cities: Transformative climate governance
   capacities in New York City, US and Rotterdam, Netherlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {843-857},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Climate change actions in cities worldwide are driving deep changes in
   urban governance. We ask whether new capacities for transformative
   climate governance are emerging in two cities that have experimented
   with urban climate governance: Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and New York
   City (NYC), United States. Transformative climate governance creates the
   conditions for developing integrated and innovative climate mitigation
   and adaptation policies and interventions that respond to and shape
   urban transformation dynamics and contribute to sustainability and
   resilience. The comparison of capacities for transformative climate
   governance in Rotterdam and NYC offers insights into the emerging
   features of urban climate governance vis-a-vis existing urban governance
   regimes: how urban climate governance is driven and delivered, what new
   governance conditions emerge, and whether these conditions enable
   transformative climate governance. In both cities, an integrated,
   experimental and inclusive approach to climate governance is emerging,
   which crosses multiple policy sectors and domains (e.g. transport,
   energy, health, justice), involves a variety of actors and facilitates
   innovative solutions. Envisioning, long-term goal and knowledge
   integration, experimentation and tapping into coalitions for change help
   to provide the basis (including guiding principles, urgency, actor
   networks, innovative solutions) for transformative climate governance.
   However, these transformative approaches tend to be still subordinate to
   business-as-usual interests and policy and planning approaches, which
   favour isolated, incremental and short-term responses. The challenge for
   strengthening transformative climate governance will be to develop
   rigorous institutional and organisational conditions that decisively
   stipulate a prioritisation of climate change across scales and sectors,
   provide action mandates and enable wider coordination, collaboration and
   learning.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {102-110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The EU introduced a new security of gas supply regulation in November
   2017, which now replaced the security of gas supply regulation of 2010.
   This article is providing a critical assessment of the new Regulation
   (EU) 2017/1938. Many instruments of the predecessor Regulation (EU)
   994/2010 will stay in place unchanged and those have been discussed
   elsewhere. This contribution will, hence, focus on the novelties and
   changes that Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 is bringing about.
   After some introductory remarks on the structure and the aims of
   Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the current article will proceed by
   discussing the two main novelties of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, which
   shall implement the main thrust of the new regulation: imposing
   obligatory solidarity between Member States in a gas crisis. These are
   first, the grouping of directly connected Member States into so called
   risk groups and second the new article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938,
   which spells out concrete solidarity measures that Member States have to
   take. In a third step other novelties of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 will
   be highlighted and critically reflected upon before the article is
   wrapped up with some conclusions.},

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {44},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One neglected socio-cultural and political dimension to the rapid
   diffusion of solar power in Sub-Saharan Africa is the question of what
   happens when things fall apart. Investors in the small-scale renewable
   energy sector are increasingly concerned with the status of broken or
   non-functioning products and there is an emerging consensus around the
   need for centralised recycling systems as the solution to future flows
   of `solar waste'.
   But what does the afterlife of off-grid solar products look like from
   below? Grounded in anthropology, geography and economic sociology, this
   paper tracks the impact of off grid solar products through contexts of
   breakdown, repair, and disposal. Combining stakeholder interviews, a
   longitudinal survey of product failure rates in Kenya and ethnographic
   research at a repair workshop in the town of Bomet, we challenge
   narratives of energy transitions that fail to address the environmental
   consequences of mass consumption and present an alternative approach to
   solar waste embedded in cultures and economies of repair.},

Abstract = {Heroin, methamphetamine and ketamine have been the most commonly abused
   drugs in Taiwan. The presence of these drugs and their metabolites in
   postmortem specimens has been routinely monitored in our laboratory
   mostly by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods. This study
   aimed to evaluate a more effective approach to simultaneously quantify
   these analytes (i.e., amphetamine, methamphetamine,
   3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA),
   morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine, 6-acetylcodeine, ketamine and
   norketamine) in postmortem urine and blood specimens by liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Samples (1 mL) were
   extracted via solid-phase extraction, evaporated and reconstituted in
   the mobile phase for injection into the LC-MS-MS system. Respective
   deuterated analogs of these analytes were used as internal standards.
   Chromatographic separation was achieved by an Agilent Zorbax SB-Aq
   analytical column at 50 degrees C. Mass spectrometric analysis was
   performed by electrospray ionization in positive-ion dynamic multiple
   reaction monitoring mode with optimized collision energy for respective
   precursor ion selected for each analyte, and the monitoring of two
   transition ions. Performance characteristics were assessed using
   drug-free samples that were fortified with 50-1,000 ng/mL of the 10
   analytes. Analytical parameters evaluated and resulting data are as
   follows: (i) average extraction recoveries (n= 3) were better than 80\%,
   except for MDMA (71\%) and morphine (74\%); (ii) inter-day and intra-day
   precision ranges (\%CV) were 1.59-8.80\% and 0.57-3.89\%, respectively;
   (iii) calibration linearity (r(2)), detection limit and quantitation
   limit for all analytes were > 0.999, 1 and 5 ng/mL, respectively; (iv)
   matrix effects (ion suppression) were observed for three analytes, but
   were satisfactorily compensated for by the deuterated internal standards
   adopted in the analytical protocol. This method was successfully applied
   to the analysis of specimens collected from unknown death cases from
   various district prosecutors' offices in Taiwan, and was also found
   helpful to understanding whether the detected opiates were derived from
   heroin or legal morphine/codeine-containing medications.},

Title = {Ten years after Copenhagen: Reimagining climate change governance in
   urban areas},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this review, we take stock of the last decade of research on climate
   change governance in urban areas since the 2009 conference in
   Copenhagen. Using a systematic evaluation of academic publications in
   the field, we argue that the current moment of research has been shaped
   by two recent waves of thought. The first, a wave ofurban optimism,
   which started in 2011 and peaked in 2013, engaged with urban areas as
   alternative sites for governance in the face of the crumbling
   international climate regime. The second, a wave ofurban pragmatism,
   which started in 2016, has sought to reimagine urban areas following the
   integration of the ``sub-national{''} as a meaningful category in the
   international climate regime after the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate
   Action. Four themes dominate the debate on climate change governance in
   urban areas: why there is climate action, how climate action is
   delivered, how it is articulated in relation to internationally reaching
   networks, and what implications it has to understand environmental or
   climate justice within urban settings. Calls to understand the impacts
   of climate change policy have fostered research on climate change
   politics, issues of power and control, conflicts, and the inherently
   unjust nature of much climate policy. What is largely missing from the
   current scholarship is a sober assessment of the mundane aspects of
   climate change governance on the ground and a concern with what kind of
   cultural and socio-economic change is taking place, beyond comparative
   analyses of the effectiveness of climate policies. This article is
   categorized under: Policy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in
   Communities, Cities, and Regions},

Title = {Equity dimensions of micro-generation: A whole systems approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Micro-generation represents one technology ready option for making the
   low carbon transition. Energy choices we make in the present have
   implications for future generations. Existing methods for formulating
   energy policy and assessing the suitability of micro-generation
   technology often concentrate upon a subset of issues relating to
   specific economic criteria or policy targets or on one technology, but
   often fail to adopt a whole systems approach or consider present or
   future equity issues. Important factors are often overlooked leading to
   poorly implemented policy or unsatisfactory technology deployment. There
   is a clear need for a process or assessment methodology that focuses
   upon equity while making choices relating to micro or small-scale
   generation projects. This paper describes an integrated whole systems
   methodology developed heuristically by a wide range of interdisciplinary
   stakeholders for use by groups of decision makers when assessing the
   equity aspects of micro-generation projects. The paper discusses the
   desirable attributes that this type of assessment should have and
   outlines the merits of the whole systems approach. Steps taken to
   develop, test, and refine the methodology using case studies are
   discussed. The equity issues arising from each case study are examined
   in wider context by quantifying the impact micro or small-scale
   generation could have within English households of varying age and
   tenure in a range of settings including a real community case study.
   This provides a snapshot of where equity issues manifest themselves and
   considers the numbers of households they affect. Using the methodology
   and focusing upon equity has allowed recommendations to be made that
   could inform future energy policy. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {A techno-economic evaluation of Virtual Net Metering for the Australian
   community housing sector},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {261},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In a climate of soaring energy prices in Australia not all consumers are
   able to afford the upfront investment costs in photovoltaics to manage
   their energy costs. Virtual Net Metering enables the sharing of
   generation and storage benefits against the load of decentralised
   customers including apartments. The aggregation of resources can reduce
   the cost for monitoring and managing distributed generation. This is
   possible by the use of innovative technology for monitoring, billing and
   settlement software. This paper provides a novel evaluation of virtual
   net metering to address social equity in the energy transition with
   regard to the Australian community housing sector.
   Modelling was conducted with Monte Carlo simulations of weather
   variables, demand and solar generation. Scenarios of solar only and
   solar combined with batteries are evaluated. Results showed that by
   pooling resources savings up to 18\% of total energy costs could be
   offered to participants for solar only schemes whereas battery prices
   would have to decline by 30\% for combined solar and battery schemes to
   achieve the same.},

Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Global institutions and national governments have failed to provide
   effective policy guidance or leadership on tackling climate change. The
   extraction and combustion of fossil fuels continues apace, resulting in
   continual rising of greenhouse gas emissions, which pose a threat to all
   life on earth. However, the global climate regime continues to
   underestimate the need for immediate, radical and powerful action.
   Dominant framings of the problem continue to emphasise behaviour change
   rather than system change, and fail to challenge the power of
   fossil-fuel capital. This failure makes it difficult to be optimistic
   about the future but there may be hope in a new kind of politics based
   on non-violent direct action and mass civil disobedience. This form of
   action is directed at delegitimising fossil fuels and stopping their
   extraction, and acting as a `radical flank' in positively influencing
   political decision-making towards a democratically agreed just
   transition.},

Title = {From crisis to context: Reviewing the future of sustainable charcoal in
   Africa},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Is charcoal a sustainable energy source in Africa? This is a crucial
   question, given charcoal's key importance to urban energy. In today's
   dominant policy narrative - the charcoal-crisis narrative - charcoal is
   deemed incompatible with sustainable and modern energy, blamed for
   looming ecological catastrophe, and demanding replacement. However, an
   emerging sustainability-through-formalization narrative posits that
   charcoal can be made sustainable - specifically, through formalization
   of production, trade, markets, and consumption technologies. This
   represents an important opportunity to go beyond the crisis narrative
   and to engage productively with charcoal. However, this ascendent
   narrative also risks misrepresenting the reality of charcoal on the
   continent and leading to inappropriate policies. The narrative's
   designation of the African charcoal sector as unsustainable at present
   obscures charcoal production's diverse and uncertain impacts across the
   continent; moreover, the association of informality with
   unsustainability obscures a similarly complex and diverse social reality
   as well as the ways that social processes and relations of power and
   inequality determine charcoal's sustainability. We argue that charcoal
   needs to be considered within its historical, social, and environmental
   contexts to better understand its present and the emergent pathways to
   sustainable energy futures. We draw upon research that is raising
   questions about both the charcoal-crisis and the
   sustainability-through-formalization narratives to argue for a new
   narrative of charcoal in context. This approaches charcoal as a
   politically, ecologically, and historically embedded resource, entailing
   significant socio-ecological complexity across diverse historical and
   geographical conjunctures, and calling for new agendas of
   interdisciplinary research with an orientation towards sustainability
   and justice.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bismuth and its compounds have been used in various optoelectronic
   devices because of their unique physical properties and non-toxic
   nature. In this present study, nanocrystalline bismuth phosphate (BiPO4)
   was synthesized by solid-state double exchange reaction and then
   processed at 150 degrees C for 30 min under nitrogen gas flow. The
   phase, morphology, purity and band gap of the sample were analyzed
   respectively using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray, Fourier transform infrared, Raman
   and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained results reveal that
   the sample exists in hexagonal phase with crystallites in sub-spherical
   morphology (similar to 84 nm) and having a direct transition band gap of
   4.52 eV. Furthermore, the x-ray attenuating nature of nanocrystalline
   BiPO(4)thick film was examined using an intra-oral diagnostic x-ray
   machine interfaced with a Suniray-2 radiography image sensor. A
   theoretical validation of the obtained x-ray attenuating nature was
   carried out using the NIST-XCOM online resource. Then, x-ray-induced
   photocurrent was measured for nanocrystalline BiPO(4)thick (200 mu m)
   film for four different doses (mGy) exposed under biased condition (2
   V). A grain boundary double Schottky potential barrier height ((b))
   model was applied to explain the observed linear dose-dependent x-ray
   sensing nature.},

Title = {When controversies cascade: Analysing the dynamics of public engagement
   and conflict in the Netherlands and Switzerland through ``controversy
   spillover{''}},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Energy controversies have been widely studied. Such studies are,
   however, generally based on either single case studies, providing rich
   and in-depth understanding of (local) dynamics of planning and
   implementation processes, or they focus on understanding responses to a
   specific technology (not bound to a location). Therefore these studies
   tend to overlook a key dynamic in controversy, namely that publics
   respond to projects by drawing on earlier experiences with a similar
   technology elsewhere, or with earlier experiences with other
   technologies in their vicinity. We refer to this dynamic as controversy
   spillover. The notion of controversy spillover helps to understand how
   the discursive space of controversy changes over time. In case studies,
   other controversies are usually considered as context, i.e. as an
   external condition. However, in order to understand the temporal
   dynamics of public engagement with energy projects, spillover from other
   controversies deserves to be investigated more as an object of interest,
   rather than as an external condition. The aim of this paper is to
   conceptualize controversy spillover as an important dynamic in
   controversies and to develop a research agenda. We identify three
   different types of spillover: 1) geographical (i.e. between the same
   energy technology in different locations), 2) historical (i.e. with
   respect to earlier experiences at the same location), 3) technology
   (i.e. between different technologies). Three empirical examples serve to
   illustrate the three types of spillover. We finalize the paper with a
   research agenda for further conceptualization and empirical analysis of
   the notion of controversy spillover.},

Abstract = {Soil depletion caused by SB and its negative repercussions on food
   safety and the sustainable development of agriculture are essential
   concerns in newly industrializing countries. Understanding and
   curtailing SB in specific regions is related to the analysis of its
   structural characteristics and justice transition. Due to the banning
   policy in China, the large-scale interview of farmers' motivations and
   behavior regarding SB is impracticable. As such, we attempted to improve
   the understanding of the influencing factors of SB in northeast China (a
   commodity grain base) by applying the up-scaling method, by using MODIS
   fire data on cropland, statistical socioeconomic data, and resource and
   environment data as well as factor analysis and multiple linear
   regression analysis. We found that bio-physical factors, agricultural
   input-output, economic development, and crop types are significant
   determinants of the intensity of SB. In the end, we asserted policy
   implications for addressing SB in northeast China.},

Title = {Ground- and excited-state properties of inorganic solids from

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {338-374},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The development in theoretical condensed-matter science based on
   density-functional theory (DFT) has reached a level where it is
   possible, from ``parameter-free{''} quantum mechanical calculations to
   obtain total energies, forces, vibrational frequencies, magnetic
   moments, mechanical and optical properties and so forth. The calculation
   of such properties are important in the analyses of experimental data
   and they can be predicted with a precision that is sufficient for
   comparison with experiments. It is almost impossible to do justice to
   all developments achieved by DFT because of its rapid growth. Hence, it
   has here been focused on a few advances, primarily from our laboratory.
   Unusual bonding behaviors in complex materials are conveniently explored
   using the combination of charge density, charge transfer, and
   electron-localization function along with crystal-orbital
   Hamilton-population analyses. It is indicated that the elastic
   properties of materials can reliably be predicted from DFT calculations
   if one takes into account the structural relaxations along with gradient
   corrections in the calculations. Experimental techniques have their
   limitations in studies of the structural stability and pressure-induced
   structural transitions in hydride materials whereas the present
   theoretical approach can be applied to reliably predict properties under
   extreme pressures. From the spin-polarized, relativistic full-potential
   calculations one can study novel materials such as ruthenates,
   quasi-one-dimensional oxides, and spin-, charge-, and orbital-ordering
   in magnetic perovskite-like oxides. The importance of
   orbital-polarization correction to the DFT to predict the magnetic
   anisotropy in transition-metal compounds and magnetic moments in
   lanthanides and actinides are emphasized. Apart from the full-potential
   treatment, proper magnetic ordering as well as structural distortions
   have to be taken into account to predict correctly the insulating
   behavior of transition-metal oxides. The computational variants LDA and
   GGA fail to predict insulating behavior of Mott insulators whereas
   electronic structures can be described correctly when correlation
   effects are taken into account through LDA + U or similar approaches to
   explain their electronic structures correctly. Excited-state properties
   such as linear optical properties, magneto-optical properties, XANES,
   XPS, UPS, BIS, and Raman spectra can be obtained from accurate DFT
   calculations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {102},

Abstract = {We have characterized the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
   spectrum of copper phthalocyanine as a function of excitation wavelength
   in the 435-635 nm region using a tunable excitation Raman system. We
   show that the Raman excitation spectrum within the surface plasmon
   resonance is dominated by totally symmetric modes in the blue and
   non-totally symmetric modes in the red. The findings are compared to our
   recent theoretical work on the nature of SERS enhancement. The
   experimental results are interpreted to be a consequence of vibronically
   coupled intensity borrowing by charge transfer resonances from allowed
   molecular transitions, enhancing non-totally symmetric modes. (C) 2013

Title = {System building in the Kenyan electrification regime: The case of
   private solar mini-grid development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {211-223},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Given the growing interest in the ability of the private sector to
   contribute to the goal of providing universal access to energy in
   developing countries, this study sets out to investigate the practices
   and business approaches of private actors in the emerging niche of
   private mini-grid development in Kenya. The paper's analytical focus is
   on how niche actors are influencing and creating change in the incumbent
   electrification regime of grid extension to strengthen and expand the
   niche for private mini-grids. The analysis shows that, in addition to
   internal niche processes like the alignment of expectations, learning
   and network building, niche actors actively engage in various forms of
   institutional work. The greatest emphasis here is on regulatory
   institutional work in order to influence legal and economic frameworks,
   but niche actors also engage in cognitive institutional work to enhance
   acceptance of the niche technology by constructing a shared world view
   between niche and regime actors. Interestingly, niche actors also engage
   in normative work to establish positive normative associations with the
   private-sector model, like equity and social justice. The research
   concludes that in this case institutional work is collective work
   drawing on different mandates and relying on different skills and
   resources.},

Title = {The transformation of provisioning systems from an integrated
   perspective of social metabolism and political economy: a conceptual
   framework},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1405-1421},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Energy, food, or mobility can be conceptualized as provisioning systems
   which are decisive to sustainability transformations in how they shape
   resource use and because of emissions resulting from them. To curb
   environmental pressures and improve societal well-being, fundamental
   changes to existing provisioning systems are necessary. In this article,
   we propose that provisioning systems be conceptualized as featuring
   integrated socio-metabolic and political-economic dimensions. In
   socio-metabolic terms, material stocks-buildings, infrastructures, and
   machines, for example-are key components of provisioning systems and
   transform flows of energy and materials into goods and services. In
   political-economic terms, provisioning systems are formed by actors,
   institutions, and capital. We loosely identify and closely analyze, from
   socio-metabolic and political-economic perspectives, five phases along
   which provisioning systems are shaped and in which specific
   opportunities for interventions exist. Relying mainly on examples from
   the fossil-fueled electricity system, we argue that an integrated
   conceptualization of provisioning systems can advance understanding of
   these systems in two essential ways: by (1) facilitating a more
   encompassing perspective on current forms of provisioning as relying on
   capitalist regulation and on material stocks and flows and by (2)
   embedding provisioning systems within their historical context, making
   it possible to conceive of more sustainable and just forms of
   provisioning under (radically) altered conditions.},

Title = {Illuminant intersections: Injustice and inequality through electricity
   and water infrastructures at the Gujarat Solar Park in India},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Solar park development in India represents yet another frontier of
   capital accumulation under the auspices of climate change mitigation and
   rural electrification, producing new social frictions in the process.
   The decarbonization of India's electrical grid has put disproportionate
   burdens on marginalized populations, a trend particularly evident with
   the Gujarat Solar Park. Aside from solar arrays, it remains unclear how
   the vast infrastructures that sustain the Gujarat Solar Park will
   influence social power asymmetries at the local scale. For example,
   solar parks need periodic cleanings to function properly, requiring vast
   amounts of water. But dryland farmers from the region lack adequate
   water resources for irrigation and domestic purposes. Drawing on
   literature from feminist political ecology and critical infrastructure
   studies, this study investigates how the sociomaterial assemblage of
   water and electrical infrastructures of the Gujarat Solar Park unevenly
   distributes surreptitious burdens across differently positioned
   peasants. This study builds upon the conceptual frameworks of
   infrastructural violence and infrastructural intersectionality to
   illuminate the pernicious gender and caste politics of India's renewable
   energy transition. Solar infrastructures, built to ameliorate energy
   insecurity, may exacerbate water scarcity and pose additional threats to
   food security by grabbing arable land and denying marginalized
   smallholders engaged in food production near solar parks the water
   resources they need to feed themselves and the nation.},

Title = {Beyond technical smartness: Rethinking the development and
   implementation of sociotechnical smart grids in India},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {158-168},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {How smart grids are understood and defined will influence the kinds of
   smart grids users will encounter in the future and their potential
   impacts. Practitioners and policymakers largely perceive smart grids as
   technological interventions. However, a number of social, financial and
   governmental interventions can also make grids smart, i.e., more
   efficient, more responsive, more inclusive and more robust. Drawing on
   qualitative research done using elite interviews, site visits and
   document analysis of eight micro-grids in India, this paper provides
   concrete examples of what could be understood as social, financial and
   governmental smartness, and in doing so, broadens the knowledge on smart
   grids beyond the technical understanding.
   This paper argues that social, financial and governmental interventions
   are central to `smartness', and that multifaceted and relational
   sociotechnical approaches will build cheaper, just, more democratic and
   sustainable smart grids. The paper observes that smart grids are not
   conceived as smart grids but rather develop incrementally. An
   incremental approach, rather than pushing a premeditated set of ideas
   and technologies, reduces adoption of non-contextual interventions as
   well as unnecessary investments in new technologies. The paper
   recommends that policymakers and practitioners should understand and
   develop smart grids as sociotechnical and incremental grids.},

Abstract = {Transition-metal-doped semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) have been well
   studied for their optical and catalytic properties but seldom studied by
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). In this paper,
   transition-metal-doped semiconductor NPs are investigated for their SERS
   property. Four groups of Co-doped (0.5, 1, 3, and 5\%) ZnO (Co?ZnO) NPs
   and pure ZnO NPs were synthesized and studied. When 4-mercaptobenzoic
   acid was used as probing molecule, significant SERS signals were
   obtained on all the five samples. Moreover, it is very interesting to
   observe a relationship between the Co-doping concentration and
   enhancement of the SERS signals. SERS intensities first increase with
   doping concentration (up to 1\%), and then decrease with further
   increase in doping concentration (up to 5\%). Charge transfer (CT) is
   considered to be the main contribution to this phenomenon. Different CT
   ratios from substrates to molecules seem to induce different intensities
   of the SERS signals. In our experiments, the crystalline defects of
   Co?ZnO NPs caused by the Co dopant affect the CT ratios. A possible
   mechanism of CT from the valance band of Co?ZnO NPs to the lower
   unoccupied molecular orbital of the molecules via energy of the surface
   states is suggested. X-ray photoelectron spectra, UV?vis spectra, and
   Raman spectra were used to characterize the structure and defects in
   Co?ZnO NPs. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {292+},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Should consensus with the utilities not be reached. Federal Minister for
   the Environment Trittin repeatedly announced to introduce opt-out
   legislation ``by dissent{''}. Both the constitutionality of such
   legislation and its compatibility with European law are topics of
   controversial debate in the literature. The decision taken by the
   Bavarian cabinet on February 8 this year to use all political and legal
   means against shutting down German nuclear power plants and, for this
   purpose, even to approach the European Commission on grounds of
   potential violation of European law, are reason enough to deal in more
   detail with the compatibility of an opt-out law with the Euratom Treaty
   and the EC Treaty. As the opt-out law does not yet exist, these
   considerations can only be of a theoretical nature. However, this is the
   working hypothesis assumed: Reprocessing is banned as of the entry into
   force of the opt-out law. This ban includes moving nuclear waste abroad
   for reprocessing. The peaceful use of nuclear power for electricity
   generation in power reactors operated for thirty years is forbidden.
   Older reactors may be run only for a transition period of another three
   years. (This includes abandoning the promotion purpose in the German
   Atomic Energy Act and a ban on building new power reactors.) However,
   the operating life may be distributed in a flexible way. This
   contribution indicates that there are sound reasons and interesting
   approaches, respectively, in the literature for assuming that opting out
   by means of legislation. coupled with a ban on reprocessing, at least
   constitutes a violation of the freedom for goods and/or services.
   However, this cannot be derived unequivocally from either the Euratom
   Treaty or the EC Treaty or from rulings by the European Court of
   Justice. Ultimately, compatibility with European law of the ban on
   reprocessing can be decided only by the European Court of Justice.},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Field-effect transistor (FET) is a very promising platform for biosensor
   applications due to its magnificent properties, including label-free
   detection, high sensitivity, fast response, real-time measurement
   capability, low running power, and the feasibility to miniaturize to a
   portable device. 1D (e.g. carbon nanotubes, Si nanowires, conductive

   materials, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, and 2D
   metal oxides) materials, with their unique structural and electronic
   properties that are unavailable in bulk materials, have helped improve
   the sensitivity of FET biosensors and enabled detection down to single

   field of 1D and 2D materials-based FET biosensors, with an emphasis on
   structure and electronic properties, synthesis, and biofunctionalization
   approaches of these nanomaterials. In addition, the progress in the
   1D/2D-FET biosensors in North America, in the last decade, is summarized

Title = {Conflicting values in the smart electricity grid a comprehensive
   overview},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {184-196},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper aims to anticipate social acceptance issues related to the
   deployment of the smart electricity grid by identifying underlying value
   conflicts. The smart electricity grid is a key enabler of the energy
   transition. Its successful deployment is however jeopardized by social
   acceptance issues, such as concerns related to privacy and fairness.
   Social acceptance issues may be explained by value conflicts, i.e. the
   impossibility for a technological or regulatory design to simultaneously
   satisfy multiple societal expectations. Due to unsatisfied expectations
   concerning values, social discontent may arise. This paper identifies
   five groups of value conflicts in the smart electricity grid: consumer
   values versus competitiveness, IT enabled systems versus data
   protection, fair spatial distributions of energy systems versus system
   performance, market performance versus local trading, and individual
   access versus economies of scale. This is important for policy-makers
   and industry to increase the chances that the technology gains
   acceptance. As resolving value conflicts requires resources, this paper
   suggests three factors to prioritize their resolution: severity of
   resulting acceptance issues, resolvability of conflicts, and the level
   of resources required. The analysis shows that particularly the
   socio-economic disparities caused by the deployment of the smart
   electricity grid are alarming. Affordable policies are currently
   limited, but the impact in terms of social acceptance may be large.},

Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the last decades, extractive industries, especially the oil and gas
   sectors, have generated significant economic activity and growth in
   countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). However, recent drop in
   oil prices and other extractive products signal a bust cycle for many of
   these GCC countries. In addition, the global transition to low carbon
   energy sources could mean that the economic mainstays of GCC countries
   could be threatened.
   With vast extractives revenue, GCC countries have over the years granted
   huge tax incentives to investors, have few tax bases, and a not so deep
   tax net. While a country has the power to exercise its fiscal
   sovereignty as it deems fit, studies show that effective tax systems
   could mobilize needed revenue for development, achieve redistributive
   justice and enhance sustainable development. This article examines the
   need for efficient, transparent and accountable tax systems in Gulf
   countries as a way of sustaining economic growth and wealth creation in
   light of dwindling extractive revenue. The article takes into account
   the cultural impact and regressive nature of taxes in the GCC countries
   and discusses ways to address the externalities which will arise from
   the adoption of robust tax systems. It also recommends that GCC
   countries broaden their tax bases to achieve diversification of revenue
   resources and encourage representation.},

Abstract = {In this study, a new kind of hybrid material was prepared from various
   amounts of silane surface modified alumina nanoparticles, oxidized ultra
   high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers, and epoxy resin. The
   reinforcing phases were selectively treated to achieve a fully connected
   network aiming an effective stress transfer between the constituents.
   The efficiency of the grafting mechanisms was confirmed by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The developed hybrid materials were tested for their mechanical,
   thermomechanical, and ballistic performances. The mechanical results,
   namely tensile and bending, confirmed the positive effects of increasing
   the nanofillers amounts up to 5 wt\%. The thermochemical properties
   analyzed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed consequent
   improvements in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature
   upon the addition of the nanophase. In the meantime, the ballistic tests
   evaluated under the National Institute of Justice standard (NIJ
   standard-0101.06-IIA) also highlighted an improved kinetic energy
   absorption following the increase in the amounts of the discontinuous
   phase. Subsequent experimentations precisely quantified the required
   number of plies for an effective projectile stopping under the chosen
   standard. Overall, this study unraveled for the first time ever the
   benefits obtained from a fully connected hybrid network under both
   static and dynamic loads.},

Abstract = {The media represents a discursive site with actors trying to influence
   the discourse on a particular subject. The paper delves into an
   exploratory analysis of the policy discourse around climate change in
   India during the 2015 Paris Agreement by tapping into the data from the
   print media. Employing Discourse Network Analysis (DNA) and drawing
   theoretical insights from the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), the
   paper aims to highlight the dominant policy beliefs and the prominent
   actors in the Indian climate policy sphere. The findings exhibit a firm
   agreement on the scientific reality of climate change, along with a
   continued emphasis on the historical responsibility of the developed
   countries. The transition to renewable energy is widely accepted, but
   coal phase-out and sustenance of nuclear power is a contentious issue.
   The study uncovers a consistent belief system underlying the climate
   change discourse in India and the challenges in the path towards future
   energy transition.},

Title = {Identification of factors affecting SEM/EDS analysis for discrimination
   and classification among common items of evidence using particle
   combination profiles},
Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {330},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article presents key factors affecting the analysis of particle
   profiles as used for discrimination and classification among items
   commonly collected at crime scenes. Identification of these factors is a
   necessary step to enable systematic improvement, optimization, and
   transition to practice. Prior research, employing reasonable initial
   choices of analytical and statistical parameters, has (1) demonstrated
   the presence of highly discriminating sets of very small particles (VSP)
   on the surfaces of items commonly collected at crime scenes, (2)
   developed statistically rigorous measurements of corre-spondence between
   VSP profiles, and (3) produced objective measures for the resulting
   probative value. In the present work the analytical and statistical
   parameters were examined more critically, identifying key factors
   affecting method performance. Experiments were conducted using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray elemental
   analysis (EDS) to characterize the elemental composition of thousands of
   individual particles within each specimen. The experiments studied:
   Reproducibility of VSP analyses at given parameters Effects of the
   SEM/EDS parameters used for the detection of each particle Effects of
   SEM/EDS x-ray analysis parameters used for elemental analysis of each
   particle Effects of the number and choice of elements used in the
   elemental analysis Effects of particle size on the strength of
   correspondence between particle sets Effects of data filtration
   parameters on the strength of correspondence between particle sets The
   experiments confirmed the presence of abundant, highly discriminating
   VSP on items commonly collected at crime scenes. The numbers of
   particles available for analysis was not a limiting factor: many more
   particles (usually greater than 50 times more) were present than were
   used for the analysis. A very high level of reproducibility was
   observed. Many of the parameters tested had no measurable effect on
   particle combination analysis performance and others had minor or
   interactive effects. Four factors were identified as having significant
   impact on the strength of correspondence between particle profiles,
   three factors were identified as having a significant impact on the
   numbers of particles detected and nine factors were identified as having
   a significant impact on analytical time and costs. The approach in its
   current state of development offers crime laboratories an additional
   capability sui-table for high priority cases. The identification of key
   factors affecting performance of the VSP analytical protocol allows
   existing methods to be further developed and systematically improved to
   facilitate tran-sition to routine practice. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Sustainable lifestyles: towards a relational approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Abstract = {The concept of sustainable lifestyles is said to have reached the limits
   of its usefulness. As commonly understood, it impedes an effective
   response to our increasingly complex world, and the associated societal
   challenges. In this context, the emerging paradigm of relationality
   might offer a way forward to renew our current understanding and
   approach. We explore this possibility in this study. First, we
   systematize if, and how, the current dominant social paradigm represents
   a barrier to sustainable lifestyles. Second, we analyze how a relational
   approach could help to overcome these barriers. On the basis of our
   findings, we develop a Relational Lifestyle Framework (RLF). Our aim is
   to advance the current knowledge by illustrating how sustainable
   lifestyles are a manifestation of identified patterns of thinking,
   being, and acting that are embedded in today's ``socioecological{''}
   realities. The RLF revitalizes the field of sustainable lifestyle
   change, as it offers a new understanding for further reflection, and
   provides new directions for policy and transformation research.},

Title = {Assessing fairness of dynamic grid tariffs},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {111-120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increase in the supply of intermittent renewable energy and the
   higher electricity use lead to stronger variation in network usage,
   which either requires costly network extensions or the implementation of
   incentives to reduce peaks. This paper focuses on the latter, namely
   dynamic tariffs. However, a tension may exist between economic arguments
   for dynamic pricing and people perceiving such pricing as unfair. This
   paper seeks to assess the fairness of dynamic tariffs through a
   combination of theoretical and empirical research. Fairness is defined
   broader than inequality; it is understood more objectively than just
   people's perceptions and thus requires engagement with ethical theory;
   and the fairness analysis is not only based on abstract ethical
   reflection but also on analysing the underlying arguments for people's
   perceptions. Both the theoretical fairness assessment and the survey
   among Dutch households reveal that dynamic tariffs are less fair than
   transport and capacity tariffs and fairer than Ramsey pricing. The
   fairness of dynamic tariffs depends on implementation conditions such
   as: clear, non-economic arguments as justification, guarantying
   basic-needs fulfilment, decreasing perception that `peak use is only for
   the rich', and increasing predictability.},

Title = {The Role of High-Dimensional Diffusive Search, Stabilization, and
   Frustration in Protein Folding},
Journal = {BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {106},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1729-1740},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Proteins are polymeric molecules with many degrees of conformational
   freedom whose internal energetic interactions are typically screened to
   small distances. Therefore, in the high-dimensional conformation space
   of a protein, the energy landscape is locally relatively flat, in
   contrast to low-dimensional representations, where, because of the
   induced entropic contribution to the full free energy, it appears
   funnel-like. Proteins explore the conformation space by searching these
   flat subspaces to find a narrow energetic alley that we call a
   hypergutter and then explore the next, lower-dimensional, subspace. Such
   a framework provides an effective representation of the energy landscape
   and folding kinetics that does justice to the essential characteristic
   of high-dimensionality of the search-space. It also illuminates the
   important role of nonnative interactions in defining folding pathways.
   This principle is here illustrated using a coarse-grained model of a
   family of three-helix bundle proteins whose conformations, once
   secondary structure has formed, can be defined by six rotational degrees
   of freedom. Two folding mechanisms are possible, one of which involves
   an intermediate. The stabilization of intermediate subspaces (or states
   in low-dimensional projection) in protein folding can either speed up or
   slow down the folding rate depending on the amount of native and
   nonnative contacts made in those subspaces. The folding rate increases
   due to reduced-dimension pathways arising from the mere presence of
   intermediate states, but decreases if the contacts in the intermediate
   are very stable and introduce sizeable topological or energetic
   frustration that needs to be overcome. Remarkably, the hypergutter
   framework, although depending on just a few physically meaningful
   parameters, can reproduce all the types of experimentally observed
   curvature in chevron plots for realizations of this fold.},

Title = {Pulling up the carbon ladder? Decarbonization, dependence, and
   third-country risks from the European carbon border adjustment mechanism},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since the EU Commission announced the introduction of a carbon border
   adjustment mechanism (CBAM) within the European Green Deal, debates
   intensified on its effectiveness for climate action, adhering to WTO
   regulations, and potential trade wars with China and the US. We argue
   that the implications of the EU CBAM for affected countries, especially
   in the Global South, have been underrepresented so far. We assess
   countries' relative risk levels in two scenarios: i) CBAM addressing
   only emissions-intensive sectors and ii) CBAM targeting the whole
   economy. The paper maps relative risks in these two scenarios using a
   risk index encompassing the export structure of countries, their
   emissions intensity, emissions reduction targets, and institutional
   capacities to monitor and report product-based emissions. The
   quantitative analysis reveals that the impacts of CBAM are distributed
   unevenly across the globe. The spectrum of impacted nations varies
   between the two analysed scenarios, but in both cases most countries at
   relatively high risk are located in Africa. Three qualitative case
   studies covering Mozambique, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Morocco
   evaluate the countries' trade relations, their carbon intensity, energy
   and climate policies, and institutional capacities, with a special focus
   on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of carbon emissions. The
   analysis sheds light on different patterns of vulnerability and policy
   options to increase resilience.},

Abstract = {The speed and uncertainty of environmental change in the Anthropocene
   challenge the capacity of coevolving social-ecological-technological
   systems (SETs) to adapt or transform to these changes. Formal government
   and legal structures further constrain the adaptive capacity of our
   SETs. However, new, selforganized forms of adaptive governance are
   emerging at multiple scales in natural resource-based SETs. Adaptive
   governance involves the private and public sectors as well as formal and
   informal institutions, self-organized to fill governance gaps in the
   traditional roles of states. While new governance forms are emerging,
   they are not yet doing so rapidly enough to match the pace of
   environmental change. Furthermore, they do not yet possess the
   legitimacy or capacity needed to address disparities between the winners
   and losers from change. These emergent forms of adaptive governance
   appear to be particularly effective in managing complexity. We explore
   governance and SETs as coevolving complex systems, focusing on legal
   systems to understand the potential pathways and obstacles to equitable
   adaptation. We explore how governments may facilitate the emergence of
   adaptive governance and promote legitimacy in both the process of
   governance despite the involvement of nonstate actors, and its adherence
   to democratic values of equity and justice. To manage the contextual
   nature of the results of change in complex systems, we propose the
   establishment of long-term study initiatives for the coproduction of
   knowledge, to accelerate learning and synergize interactions between
   science and governance and to foster public science and epistemic
   communities dedicated to navigating transitions to more just,
   sustainable, and resilient futures.},

Title = {Agriculture and degrowth: State of the art and assessment of organic and

Abstract = {Agriculture stands as the foundation of modern human societies. Any
   changes in social functioning should seriously consider how to guarantee
   people a proper supply of food, in terms of both quantity and quality.
   Degrowth is a movement that aims at achieving a radical change in the
   societal metabolism of societies, toward a more frugal, sustainable and
   convivial lifestyle. The movement envisages a society where concepts as
   sharing, conviviality, care, commons, justice could stand at its
   foundation, and replace the call for economic growth, which is,
   obviously, biophysically unsustainable. This paper aims to (1) review
   how agriculture has been addressed within the degrowth discourse, (2)
   analyse the relation between agriculture and societal metabolism and its
   relevance from a degrowth perspective, (3) discuss how different
   agricultural techniques and technologies may represent appropriate
   technologies (sensu Schumacher, 1973), and meet the call for
   conviviality (sensu Illich, 1975). The latter point focusses on a
   comparison between organic agriculture (OA, which bans the use of
   agrochemicals and Genetically Modified Organisms - CMOs) and
   biotech-based agriculture (BTA, reliant on CMOs). The paper points out
   that although many relevant socioeconomic, political and environmental
   issues have been addressed by degrowth scholars, agriculture is still
   poorly analysed. Recommendations are made with regard to studying
   possible alternative transition paths, by assessing their impact on
   society's structure and functioning. It is argued that
   ``conviviality{''} and ``appropriate technology{''} concepts are rather
   complex and multifaceted. Therefore, different practices might be
   considered convivial and appropriate under some criteria, and not under
   others. With regard to conviviality, organic agriculture might not fully
   respond to the call for autonomy. Notwithstanding claims made by GMOs
   supporters, BTA does neither suit the call for appropriate technology,
   nor represent a convivial tool under any criteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {A New Approach to Partnerships for SDG Transformations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent scientific reports highlight the urgent need for transformations
   to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and long-term
   sustainability. This paper presents a new approach to partnerships that
   focuses on their role in transformations, the types of partnerships that
   may be needed and their enabling environment. It introduces
   transformation effectiveness as a criterion to evaluate a portfolio of
   partnerships and pathways as a tool to frame discussion of required
   partnerships. Guided by energy decarbonization and using a simple model
   of partnership formation, I highlight a (potential) mismatch between the
   types of partnerships required for transformation and the partnership
   types arising under the currently dominant voluntary approach. The model
   suggests the bottom-up approach can deliver some, but not all, of the
   partnerships needed. Five specific problems are identified-compensation
   for losers, partnering capacity, short-time horizons, inadequate
   coordination mechanisms and misaligned incentives. The paper then
   outlines some policy tools-transfers, regulation, public
   investment-governments could use to strengthen the bottom-up framework
   and orchestrate missing partnerships. The conclusion addresses two
   problems specific to the transformation approach: how to identify more
   systematically the partnerships needed (identification problem) and how
   to implement them (implementation problem); and outlines some ways to
   deal with these-science, deliberation, international leadership
   coalitions and frameworks/monitoring systems for transition
   partnerships.},

Abstract = {The molecular charge transfer reactions of quinine (Q) with
   2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) and
   7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a pi-acceptor to form charge
   transfer (CT) complexes have been studied. The CT complexes were
   characterized by infrared spectra, NMR, mass spectrometry, conductometry
   and spectrometry. The Q-DDQ and Q-TCNQ charge transfer complexes were
   monitored at 480 and 843 nm, respectively. The results confirm the
   formation of CT complexes. The molar ratio of Q:DDQ and Q: TCNQ assessed
   using Job's method was 1:1, which agrees with the results obtained by
   the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. The stability of the formed CT complexes
   was assessed by measuring different spectroscopic parameters such as
   oscillator strength, transition dipole moment, ionization potential, the
   energy of CT complex, resonance energy, dissociation energy and standard
   free energy change. The DFT geometry optimization of quinine, DDQ and
   TCNQ, its charge transfer complex, and UV theoretical vs. experimental
   comparative study were carried out. The theoretical and experimental
   results agreed. DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory was used for the
   investigation of charge transfer between quinine as electron donor and
   (DDQ and TNCQ) as electron acceptors. The geometric structures, orbital
   energies, HOMO, LUMO and energy gaps were determined. The transition
   energies of the charge transfer complexes were computed using the
   TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The computed parameters were
   comparable to the experimental parameters, and the computational results
   aided in the analysis of the data.},

Abstract = {While the recent political transition in Egypt has delayed much-needed
   policy reforms, our paper suggests that under certain conditions,
   fostering the national renewable energy strategy may be a promising way
   of giving an ailing economy an urgently needed impetus. Based on the
   literature and results of a renewable-energy focused computable general
   equilibrium model, we recommend that Egypt supports the generation of
   wind power. While some energy may be exported to generate foreign
   exchange, a substantial part of the newly produced energy should be sold
   domestically to ease existing supply constraints and to avoid Dutch
   disease effects. In addition, and in order to maximize the benefits of
   renewable energy sources, the renewable energy strategy should be
   accompanied by a (further) reduction of energy subsidies. Finally,
   lessons from other countries suggest that sound institutions;
   appropriate, clear and lasting regulations; careful technology transfer;
   and cross-ministerial coordination are important for success.},

Abstract = {Transition metal nitrides are promising alternative plasmonic materials
   to noble metals for data storage applications as they exhibit localized
   surface plasmon resonances and have high melting temperatures. Here,
   angle dependent spectral measurements of the plasmonic resonances of
   nanodisk arrays made from titanium nitride are examined. Polarized light
   is used to excite the quadrupole and higher order resonance plasmonic
   modes which are required in the state-of-the-art designs of near-field
   transducers used in plasmonic enhanced magnetic recording. Numerical
   simulations compare the energy distribution and absorption efficiencies
   for different sized Au and Ti nanodisks. A high electric field
   enhancement is calculated at the termination of a lollipop plasmonic
   transducer made of titanium nitride which is shifted to longer
   wavelengths when compared with an Au transducer of the same dimensions.
   This, together with its outstanding material properties makes TiN a
   favourable material for data storage applications. (C) 2017 Optical

Title = {Relevance analysis of social equity and urbanization based on fuzzy
   logic and factor analysis model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},

Pages = {6229-6240},
Abstract = {The accelerated development of urbanization in China started with
   economic globalization and industrialization, and also in the process of
   economic system transition. Generally speaking, urbanization is an
   important indicator of a region's economic development and social
   development. Urbanization equity is an important direction of
   sustainable economic and social development. From the economic
   dimension, urbanization can promote division of labor, specialization
   and accumulation of human capital through agglomeration effect. This
   paper analyzes the social equity and urbanization by using fuzzy logic
   and factor analysis model. Under the condition of market economy,
   migrant workers have no competitive advantage in the labor market
   because of their low educational level. At the same time, the treatment
   of migrant workers in social security, cultural education and economic
   welfare is lower than that of urban residents. Under the unbalanced
   economic development reality, the economic absorption effect leads to
   the migrant workers rushing to the developed big cities. The results
   shows that by taking the dimensions of social justice of the rural
   migrant worker as the independent variable, psychological urbanization
   for the dependent variable, the regression Equation of F value is
   90.424, P = 0.000, less than 0.05 level of significance. Also, we make
   correlation analysis on all factors of social justice and urbanization.
   The experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed method.
   Green building is the development of sustainable development concept in
   architectural field. While the construction industry has brought great
   benefits to the development of national economy, its high investment,
   high pollution and inefficient development mode has also produced a huge
   energy load. Therefore, from the perspective of environmental and
   economic sustainability, the development of green buildings is
   particularly important. In this paper, the author makes economic benefit
   analysis of green building based on fuzzy logic and bilateral game
   model. By introducing such factors as economic benefits, cognition and
   government policies, this paper construct an evolutionary game model,
   which provides a basis for improving the economic benefits of green
   buildings. The results show that the first factor affecting enterprise
   decision-making is the incremental profit of green building developers,
   followed by the government's incentive policy. After the evolution of
   the market, the final strategic choice will be stabilized to higher
   economic benefits. Generally speaking, green buildings need to
   effectively control incremental costs and consider scale benefits.
   Through management efficiency innovation and policy stimulation, the
   problems of huge investment cost and long payback period can be solved,
   so as to improve the economic benefits of green building development.},

Title = {Health reform in Mexico: governance and potential outcomes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Adopting key mechanisms to restructure public policy in developing
   countries is a crucial political task. The strengthening of
   infrastructure of health services, care quality, monitoring and
   population health; all might contribute to assuring the functionality of
   a national system for health monitoring and care. Over the last decades,
   the Mexican government has launched wide-ranging political reforms
   aiming to overcome socioeconomic and environmental problems, namely
   health, education, finances, energy and pension. The proposed (but yet
   not implemented) health reform in Mexico during E. Pena Nieto's
   administration (2012-2018) pretended an adjustment in Article 4 of the
   Mexican Constitution to compact medical care and reduce the State's
   responsibility to a provision of minimum health packages for the
   population. Here we use a simple analytical model to describe and
   interprete the concepts of context, process, actors and content and the
   outcome of three of the most important resulting components of this
   intended reform i.e. universality, basic packages, and outsourcing'. In
   light of the start of the Mexico's new federal administration, we argue
   that, if not properly defined by all actors, the implementation of such
   structural health reform in Mexico would precipitate a model of
   private/public association exacerbating a crisis of political
   representation, human rights, justice and governance.},

Journal = {ERDKUNDE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {297-312},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Transnational debates, for instance on the finiteness of fossil
   resources and their harmful effects on the climate, are often regarded
   as interdisciplinary challenges in the social and natural sciences. By
   contrast, in the past two decades, notably in the 2000s, geography
   appears to have been forgetful of resources. In this paper it is argued
   that more attention needs to be paid to resource studies in human
   geography. It starts by comparing existing understandings and
   definitions of resources in respect of their usefulness as guiding
   concepts for research. This is followed by an overview of
   resource-related debates in various subdisciplines of geography. In
   (environmental) economic geography, the concept of global production
   networks has proved helpful for the discussion of problems connected
   with resources. An adaptation of this concept is presented here which
   can be used to analyse material and energy flows with the aid of social
   categories (e.g. such as power relations or governance) and to evaluate
   them in the light of normative categories (e.g. ecological
   sustainability or environmental justice).},

Title = {Democratizing global climate governance? The case of indigenous
   representation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)},
Journal = {GLOBALIZATIONS},
Abstract = {Indigenous communities have a particular stake in climate and energy
   developments, and have come to occupy a central role in both the
   movement toward decarbonization of industrial societies and renewable
   energy transition. Yet they remain underrepresented and excluded from
   climate policy processes. This paper critically evaluates the case of
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to foster inclusive
   decision-making, with a specific focus on the place of Indigenous
   peoples in these processes. We demonstrate the ways in which the IPCC
   provides limited voice for Indigenous peoples in the Panel's
   deliberations. We argue the IPCC's disregard for Indigenous knowledges -
   and Indigenous peoples - arises from a configuration of structural
   problems within the governance of decarbonization and the politics of
   knowledge production. We conclude the IPCC faces on-going challenges in
   supporting the democratic functioning of climate decision-making,
   including in upholding Indigenous peoples' internationally recognized
   human rights as political actors.},

   mitigation measures may support the mobilisation of place attachment for
   climate mitigation, including renewable energy deployment. We
   hypothesise that local visioning may support movement towards change
   readiness by helping to anchor unfamiliar social representations of low
   carbon energy infrastructure and new patterns of urban form in existing,
   more positive representations of localities and associated attachments.
   To this end, seeking ways to modify threat perceptions relating to

Journal = {BIOETHICS},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So
   attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave
   like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a
   person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health
   ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but
   particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have
   distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics.
   For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has
   been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in
   medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the
   domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over
   issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory
   vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an
   individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the
   one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the
   health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting
   across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another
   discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in
   bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be
   called an `applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying
   moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice.
   A contrasting `relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative
   interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency,
   interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many
   specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational
   approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful.
   It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as
   autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different
   meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when
   they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my
   aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within
   bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and
   the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice.
   I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral
   questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively
   integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health
   must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support
   for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the
   intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging
   society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and
   public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not
   dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent
   surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand,
   care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has
   been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for
   care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current
   ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and
   politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core
   problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive
   contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and
   articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those
   oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention,
   attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable
   and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as
   subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other
   in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and
   attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically
   motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and
   the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic
   willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity;
   (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health
   and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the
   actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould
   observes concerning solidarity on this score: `the proliferation of
   solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences,
   along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within
   solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions
   of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the
   protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen
   and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as
   they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion
   explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of
   solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take
   toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of
   a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The
   guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of
   other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition
   of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my
   explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to
   sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a
   conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing
   on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on
   conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social
   sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various
   kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and
   hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of
   critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both
   methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned
   with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with
   synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret
   Urban Walker has called the `expressive-collaborative' model of morality
   over the `theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency
   of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and
   interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group
   transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural
   interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power.
   Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness
   and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and
   its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical
   grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away
   from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and
   rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including
   bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially
   when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is
   to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints
   over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of
   question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While
   chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a
   critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking
   about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on
   substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been
   relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in
   ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or
   logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be
   taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going,
   contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available
   theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based
   practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning
   this contest, we should `see the process as basic and never ending, and
   {[}subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than {[}imagine] that
   it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational
   practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and
   structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power
   in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as
   diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape
   contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social
   life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However,
   when these patterns endure they comprise `practices', which may be
   defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which
   diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the
   social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this
   definition more fully. First, social practices are structured
   sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power,
   distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are
   examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of
   various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured
   normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value.
   Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of
   social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations
   are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped,
   and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How
   are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the
   theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian
   orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible
   by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what
   other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read
   the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact
   together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic
   and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone
   justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the
   possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A
   practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed
   by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible
   activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to
   actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies
   provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It
   is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are
   respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences
   are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually
   constructed or `theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but
   they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or
   innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied
   and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit
   knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and
   pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative
   deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that
   shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair
   MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of
   phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of
   Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins
   suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at `the root of
   the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the
   object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not
   interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a
   classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental
   awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a
   call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who
   is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim
   to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership
   rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit
   right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of
   solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of
   what has been called `interpretive phenomenology' and has been well
   developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is
   clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw
   important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more
   broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper
   understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves
   may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious
   than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The
   following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner
   informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought
   in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change,
   transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal
   ellipsis The ethos embedded in {[}interpretive] phenomenology is respect
   for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices,
   skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices
   allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from
   our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what
   they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it,
   this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in
   and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and
   concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the
   watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and
   interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of
   right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism,
   reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social
   institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive,
   discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values
   as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for
   the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can
   clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly
   mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent
   studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One
   is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular
   and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty.
   The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it
   unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather
   than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a
   normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick
   solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that
   they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a
   critique of what she calls `conventional solidarity', and defines a
   counter-notion of `reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which
   in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be
   at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only
   one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol
   Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan
   orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning
   it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of
   political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive
   agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can
   emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast
   to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and
   narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned
   that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the
   primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of
   solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into
   something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in
   the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the
   inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. `Conscience just isn't
   enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role
   in them,' he writes. `Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of
   solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's
   own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that
   could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ` Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the
   views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should
   prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral
   outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives
   voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than
   containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and
   agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all.
   Thus Kolers defines solidarity as `reason-driven political action on
   other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more
   dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and
   Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both
   reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of
   networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and
   power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right
   recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand
   thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled
   commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can
   mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize
   the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so
   that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of
   moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at
   first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper
   understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical
   maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on
   solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and
   Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis
   of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social
   organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in
   understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction
   between agency and the institutional structures within which agency
   takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative
   idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force
   develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own
   approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive
   and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation
   among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively
   working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest
   to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and
   practices of community, but who crucially brings community and
   solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what
   might be called `comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to
   follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of
   solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and
   community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more
   intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making
   community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy,
   one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds
   solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation
   is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of
   people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the
   group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense,
   two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity
   between its members. `Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in
   the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means
   that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental
   weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there
   must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic
   injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative
   aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity
   and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices;
   what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and
   how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is
   constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity
   begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time.
   It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on
   the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that
   others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the
   moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make
   in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and
   symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then
   intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly
   exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within
   it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as
   bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of
   others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of
   solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly
   one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In
   addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others
   whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing
   up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode
   of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting,
   defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against
   exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the
   other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it
   makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and
   acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one
   can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life.
   What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge
   differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and
   some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other.
   This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits
   for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge
   the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it
   does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity
   can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up
   with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the
   recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the
   standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and
   lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless
   resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the
   ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such
   understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can
   only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer
   understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship
   further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who
   stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning
   others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must
   open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other
   people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of
   self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific
   standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for
   intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly
   within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as.
   The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this
   suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers
   of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The
   solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering
   connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but
   rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and
   perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in
   the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral
   life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment
   to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the
   other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby
   embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal
   human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and
   distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a
   perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually
   meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in
   the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary
   membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a
   comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the
   other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this
   interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably
   a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the
   perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral
   awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are
   plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the
   trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in
   the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling
   human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need
   mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity
   need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible
   support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents
   of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually
   reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as
   affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral
   significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are
   premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but
   are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those
   who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing
   on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward
   mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the
   individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance
   on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common
   background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability,
   insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons
   in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a
   universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine
   (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where
   solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and
   impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially)
   described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very
   young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their
   cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay,
   point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of
   maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once
   they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering
   role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in
   time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so
   only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous
   generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and
   reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships.
   Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual
   possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties
   that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or
   once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views
   care as a concrete universal, or a `species activity' and has proposed
   that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and
   repair our `world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That
   world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which
   we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides
   yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care.
   Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and
   on `properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like
   their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity
   and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however,
   we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the
   ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all
   practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a
   response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for.
   Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive
   commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring
   have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational
   bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just
   in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical
   specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with
   virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas
   (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or
   sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring
   as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and
   intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects
   on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural
   and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social
   order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again
   to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of
   care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has
   already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes
   among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving.
   Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care.
   Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need
   of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving
   involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the
   practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many
   distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work.
   It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other
   forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a
   distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient
   will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These
   distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's
   concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate
   institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I
   seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral
   awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as
   I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the
   practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of
   personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture
   of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is
   fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a
   distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay
   attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may
   change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right
   recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of
   acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying
   attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of
   such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the
   same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this
   sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or
   reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink
   rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the
   oppressor-is a gesture that extracts `payment' in the form of public
   witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of
   virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in
   terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom
   the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets
   priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account
   of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or
   psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth
   the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified
   focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and
   services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of
   invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda,
   understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to
   care for his father. `Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to
   help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal,
   both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability,
   suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to
   bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions
   are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human
   condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented
   to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent
   the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only
   diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and
   recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There
   are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in
   need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here.
   I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and
   attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are
   relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side
   having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of
   initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity,
   this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care
   rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the
   other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in
   need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it,
   repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is
   impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to
   construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for
   the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or
   physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest
   to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is
   certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the
   patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of
   function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to
   solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the
   line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred.
   But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do
   with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond
   restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other.
   Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to,
   physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly
   important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get
   at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and
   assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the
   other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of
   the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the
   human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect
   of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of
   connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes
   perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something
   perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional
   bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In
   any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is
   built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance
   applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of
   care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet
   needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being
   left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not
   realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is
   more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive
   companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the
   other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form
   of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they
   experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care
   process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a
   step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of
   gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the
   gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the
   realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the
   developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational
   gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own
   lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely
   parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the
   constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of
   significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion.
   This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve
   military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended
   to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the
   sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the
   heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the
   human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a
   better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the
   other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection,
   in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and
   embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care
   recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to,
   precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the
   structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as
   well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families)
   cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant
   social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment
   would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care
   services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of
   social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be
   altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the
   information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and
   service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of
   a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and
   supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also
   in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices
   of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more
   just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the
   broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying
   attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce
   one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and
   domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet,
   when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture,
   protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much
   domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her
   own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and
   loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the
   positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose
   in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among
   individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite
   their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not
   solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude
   felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have
   made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the
   practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be
   present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and
   suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and
   care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of
   repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares

   a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic
   pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in
   this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than
   specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct
   physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological
   assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching,

   THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes
   Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative
   interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency
   and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational
   bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that
   are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of
   solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the
   affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral
   subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The
   recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt
   progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for
   equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social
   resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to
   focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential
   flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally
   developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing
   up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a
   morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive
   rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another,
   and attentive commitment to another.},

Abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the 70th-anniversary issue of the
   Journal and analyses criminal investigation themed papers published in
   the Journal. The analyses here presents a proposed form for future
   publishing and research that will include transition to the quantum
   technological revolution that brings changes in contemporary forms of
   crime. It begins with research contributions of Pear and Mayer, who have
   periodically pointed out the problems with the development of criminal
   investigation in Slovenia. Their findings were updated with an analysis
   of 88 articles from the Journal of Criminal Investigation and
   Criminology and with analysis of 211 articles in the journal Criminal
   Investigation Service. The review reveals insights into contributions
   from the field of criminal investigation and a departure from the
   original goals that were set up the jJournal was initially launched.
   However, it presents a good starting point for setting publishing goals
   in the future. From the prevailing professional articles and case
   studies, a transition to scientific contributions is shown. We also find
   that most contributions do not offer concrete solutions and only a few
   contributions suggest changes. Therefore, we propose to focus on an
   ideal paper to be co-authored by theorists and practitioners, which
   would at the same time satisfy the demands of the Journal, as well as
   preserve practical usage in the field. Such an approach would also
   improve the knowledge base of the practitioners. If we want to
   successfully fight modern forms of criminality, it is necessary to
   implement the achievements of the new technological revolution as well
   good practices from abroad and use them in solutions and changes in
   Slovenia. Incentives are the resources of the European Commission in the
   Horizon 2020 Program dedicated to quantum technology particularly in the
   fields of communications, security, defence and energy. Therefore, in
   the future, the research teams that will compete for planned financial
   resources in the field of security will need to include researchers in
   the fields of criminal investigation, criminology and information
   security. It is also important to connect with others, and the Faculty
   of Criminal Justice and Security can play an important role. Strong
   emphasis must be placed on education and training in new technologies
   and the usability of these in revealing, investigating and solving
   crimes, but of course for this to happen, quality articles are needed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on the mutually interrelated processes of
   constructing urban retrofit and the city-region as a scale for action.
   Urban retrofitting - the systematic reconfiguration of
   socio-technologies of energy in the existing built environment and
   infrastructure - is critical to the achievement of ambitious carbon
   reduction targets. To realise the ecological and economic benefits of
   retrofit cities are continually searching for a `fix' that allows them
   to upscale retrofit from a largely ad hoc and piecemeal activity of
   repair and maintenance into strategic and systemic retrofit programmes
   that transform existing cities. This article is primarily concerned with
   understanding the politics and purpose of such experimentation and
   analyses efforts to integrate retrofit and governing in Greater
   Manchester. To do this, the article draws on a programme of interviews
   with national, city-regional, local authority and neighbourhood scale
   actors, documentary analysis and observations. We address on who is
   constructing retrofit responses in Greater Manchester and also why they
   are being constructed: Is it to transform the city-region and, if so, in
   what ways? And ask, in what ways are governance frameworks mediating and
   interpreting wider sets of global pressures at city-regional scale and
   which of these - economic, ecological, governing, social justice, etc. -
   pressures are more and less prioritised? We set out dominant
   city-regional responses (ON), alternative responses (IN) and assess the
   possibilities for integrated responses (WITH).},

Title = {Mobilizing Investors for Blue Growth},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The European Union's Blue Growth Strategy is a long term strategy to
   support sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, aiming to
   contribute to innovation and economic growth (European Commission,
   2012). The EU sees the financial sector as a key partner to bring about
   transition to sustainable consumption and production. However, knowledge
   about investment behavior, experience with working with these investors,
   and ways to engage investors in the Blue Growth sectors is lacking. This
   paper examines this knowledge gap. It characterizes investors and
   identifies investor behavior, investors' motives, and conditions and
   criteria relevant for investors to invest in Blue Growth sectors. The
   presented results are derived from a literature study on investors and
   investment behavior, an electronic survey and in-depth interviews.
   Stereotypical images of private equity bankers or wealthy individuals do
   not do justice to the diversity of investors involved in the Blue Growth
   sectors. These sectors are still in development and various risks reduce
   the willingness to invest. Risk mitigation should be seen as a shared
   responsibility of entrepreneurs, investors and governments. Government
   support must go further than financial support for research and
   development or technological demonstration projects. Proven technologies
   get stuck in the Valley of Death as investors alone are not willing to
   take the risk associated with upscaling of promising technologies. Tied
   in a reciprocal relationship, governments need to attract private
   investors-their capital, knowledge, and networks-to further grow of the
   Blue Growth sectors while investors need stable, predictable, and
   effective government support schemes to mitigate their financial risks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE},

Abstract = {A new series of Cr(III), Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Hg(II) complexes of
   Schiff-bases derived from the condensation of
   4-(2-pyridyl)-3-thiosemicarbazide and pyruvic acid (H2PTP) have been
   synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic studies. Schiff-base
   exhibit thiol-thione tautomerism wherein sulfur plays an important role
   in the coordination. The coordination possibility of the Schiff-bases
   towards metal ions have been proposed in the light of elemental
   analysis, spectral (IR, UV-vis, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR), magnetic and
   thermal studies. IR spectra show that H2PTP is coordinated to the metal
   ions in a mononegative tridentate manner except in Cr(III) complex in
   which the ligand exhibits mononegative bidentate manner. The parameters
   total energy, binding energy, isolated atomic energy, electronic energy,
   heat of formation, dipole moment, HOMO and LUMO were calculated for the
   ligand and its complexes. Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic
   parameters for the different decomposition steps were calculated using
   the Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Also, the optical band
   gap (Eg) of the metal complexes has been calculated. The optical
   transition energy (Eg) is direct and equals 3.20, 3.27 and 3.26 eV for
   Cr, Mn and Ni complexes, respectively. The synthesized ligand, in
   comparison to its metal complexes is screened for its antibacterial
   activity against the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis,
   Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa and Escherichia coli. The
   results show that the metal complexes be more potent in activity
   antibacterial than the parent Shciff base ligand towards one or more
   bacterial species. Finally, the biochemical studies showed that, Mn
   complex have powerful and complete degradation effect on DNA. (c) 2012

Abstract = {A high-statistics exclusive study of the multifragmentation of 1A GeV
   gold on carbon has been performed. Particles with Z less than or equal
   to 2 show evidence of emission in a first prompt stage as well as in a
   second equilibrium stage whereas fragments with Z greater than or equal
   to 3 appear to be emitted essentially only in the second stage. Two
   methods for the separation of the Z less than or equal to 2 particles
   into the two stages are given and they are ill agreement. The yields for
   each stage are determined as a function of the event charged particle
   multiplicity m. The mass, nuclear charge, excitation energy per nucleon,
   and temperature of the remnant left after the first stage and their
   fluctuations have been determined as a function of m. The expansion of
   the remnant to fragment freeze-out is examined. The freeze-out
   temperature is determined from double isotope ratios as a function of,li
   and isentropic trajectories are obtained in the temperature-density
   plane. The caloric curve shows a monotonic increase with excitation
   energy. Some of the energy is in the form of radial flow. Overall, the
   results are consistent with a previous statistical analysis of the data
   which suggests that, over a certain range of excitation energies,
   multifragmentation involves a continuous phase transition.},

Abstract = {Archaea are widely distributed and yet are most often not the most
   abundant members of microbial communities. Here, we document a
   transition from Bacteria- to Archaea-dominated communities in microbial
   biofilms sampled from the Richmond Mine acid mine drainage (AMD) system
   (similar to pH 1.0, similar to 38 degrees C) and in
   laboratory-cultivated biofilms. This transition occurs when
   chemoautotrophic microbial communities that develop at the air-solution
   interface sink to the sediment-solution interface and degrade under
   microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The archaea identified in these
   sunken biofilms are from the class Thermoplasmata, and in some cases,
   the highly divergent ARMAN nanoarchaeal lineage. In several of the
   sunken biofilms, nanoarchaea comprise 10 to 25\% of the community, based
   on fluorescent in situ hybridization and metagenomic analyses.
   Comparative community proteomic analyses show a persistence of bacterial
   proteins in sunken biofilms, but there is clear evidence for amino acid
   modifications due to acid hydrolysis. Given the low representation of
   bacterial cells in sunken biofilms based on microscopy, we infer that
   hydrolysis reflects proteins derived from lysed cells. For archaea, we
   detected similar to 2,400 distinct proteins, including a subset involved
   in proteolysis and peptide uptake. Laboratory cultivation experiments
   using complex carbon substrates demonstrated anaerobic enrichment of
   Ferroplasma and Aplasma coupled to the reduction of ferric iron. These
   findings indicate dominance of acidophilic archaea in degrading biofilms
   and suggest that they play roles in anaerobic nutrient cycling at low
   pH.},

   The mean mass, charge, excitation energy, and the initial temperature
   T-i of the remnant have been determined as a function of the total
   charge multiplicity, m, as has the freeze-out temperature T-f. Both T-i
   and T-f increase linearly with m and their values at the critical point
   have been determined. T-f rises monotonically with excitation energy as

Abstract = {This article offers a framework for analyzing and extending the recent
   wave of national ``keep it in the ground{''} (KIIG) bans on fossil fuel
   exploration and production. We situate this discussion in new
   theoretical work on decarbonization acceleration and then present an
   overview of KIIG movement and policy development. Next, drawing on the
   burgeoning supply side climate policy literature, we outline major
   barriers to constraining fossil fuel development, then focus on
   identifying conditions most conducive for KIIG policy. These include
   locally-rooted campaigns, the development of a pro-KIIG constituency
   that is horizontally dense and vertically integrated, resonant message
   framing, and support by well-placed norm entrepreneurs. We argue that
   early national efforts to keep fossil fuels in the ground demark a
   critical juncture in global climate policy. Understanding the trajectory
   of these bans is a first step in extending these initiatives as part of
   the pathway to carbon neutrality by 2050.},

Title = {Covalent Surface Modification of Ti3C2Tx MXene with Chemically Active

Journal = {ACS NANO},

Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {As interest continues to grow in Ti3C2Tx and other related MXenes,
   advancement in methods of manipulation of their surface functional
   groups beyond synthesis-based surface terminations (T-x: -F, -OH, and
   =O) can provide mechanisms to enhance solution processability as well as
   produce improved solid-state device architectures and coatings. Here, we
   report a chemically important surface modification approach in which
   ``solvent-like{''} polymers, polyethylene glycol carboxylic acid
   (PEG6-COOH), are covalently attached onto MXenes via esterification
   chemistry. Surface modification of Ti3C2Tx with PEG6-COOH with large
   ligand loading (up to 14\% by mass) greatly enhances dispersibility in a
   wide range of nonpolar organic solvents (e.g., 2.88 mg/mL in chloroform)
   without oxidation of Ti3C2Tx two-dimensional flakes or changes in the
   structure ordering. Furthermore, cooperative interactions between
   polymer chains improve the nanoscale assembly of uniform microstructures
   of stacked MXene-PEG6 flakes into ordered thin films with excellent
   electrical conductivity (similar to 16,200 S.cm(-1)). Most importantly,
   our covalent surface modification approach with omega-functionalized
   PEG6 ligands (omega-PEG6-COOH, where omega: -NH2, -N-3, -CH=CH2) allows
   for control over the degree of functionalization (incorporation of
   valency) of MXene. We believe that installing valency onto MXenes
   through short, ion conducting PEG ligands without compromising MXenes'
   features such as solution processability, structural stability, and
   electrical conductivity further enhance MXenes surface chemistry
   tunability and performance and widens their applications.},

Abstract = {The adoption of green building certification schemes, such as Leadership
   in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Schools, establishes
   common building factors among certified schools. Many building factors
   influence student performance outcomes including cognitive skills,
   standardized test scores and rates of absenteeism. This review
   synthesizes current research from 28 new studies and 101 other studies
   that were previously included in 15 reviews of associations between
   LEED-specified building factors and these performance outcomes in
   schools. In appraising the relative quantity and quality of studies,
   along with the frequency of LEED credits found in certified schools,
   this review finds that building features common to 100\% of
   LEED-certified schools also have the strongest research supporting
   associations with academic outcomes, and largely come under the purview
   of indoor air quality (e.g., minimum ventilation rate, filtration or air
   cleaning) and acoustic performance. Comparatively, building factors
   related to the school site and daylighting have fewer associated
   studies, but findings suggest these are good targets for future research
   as they may be important for influencing student performance. Achieving
   a transition to a lower carbon future requires that schools be built
   with their energy impacts in mind; and this review provides value to
   those involved in the planning and design of these green schools that
   facilitate improved student performance outcomes.},

   tetradentate, respectively. From the modeling studies, the bond length,
   bond angle, HOMO, LUMO and dipole moment had been calculated to confirm
   the geometry of the ligands and their investigated complexes. The
   thermal studies showed the type of water molecules involved in metal
   complexes Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the
   different decomposition steps were calculated using the Coats-Redfern
   and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Also, the optical band gap (Eg) has been
   calculated to elucidate the conductivity of the isolated complexes. The
   optical transition energy (Eg) is direct and equals 3.34 and 3.44 ev for
   Ni and Fe complexes, respectively. The ligand and their metal complexes
   were screened for antibacterial activity against the following bacterial
   species, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas
   aeuroginosa and Escherichia coli. The results revealed that the metal
   complexes have more potent antibacterial compared with the ligand. Also,
   the degradation effect of the investigated compounds was tested showing
   that, Ni complex exhibited powerful and complete degradation effect on

Abstract = {The intermediate-sized cities of southern Chile experience days of high
   pollution levels every winter due to the use of wood-burning stoves.
   Several studies have analysed the factors that hinder energy transition
   and the social acceptance of measures to improve air quality, the
   consequences of which are disturbing. However, they have mainly focused
   on health issues without considering the social impacts of air
   pollution. This study aims to assess whether exposure to outdoor air
   pollution is associated with school absenteeism. We analysed the records
   of approx. 5,000 students in the fourth grade from 25 schools in five
   cities in southern Chile (2010-2017). Using a fixed-effects model and
   applying it to the school level, we were able to estimate the effect of
   air pollution on absenteeism from school after controlling for the
   effects of individual characteristics. Previous studies have found that
   independent of air pollution, students from low-income families have a
   higher absenteeism rate. Our findings suggest that as air pollution
   worsens, pupils from middle and high-income households are also more
   likely to miss school days. We argue that this is, presumably, because
   high-income families are able to develop protective behaviour such as
   bringing their children to the doctor or keeping them at home on highly
   polluted days.},

Abstract = {Global reliance on fossil fuels presents a significant obstacle to
   climate change mitigation. While numerous countries have committed to
   phasing out their reliance on fossil fuels, many have not followed
   through on their promises. We consider the Czech Republic, which is
   attempting to expand coal mining despite the industry's history of
   environmental devastation. Drawing on the literatures regarding elite
   legitimation and fossil fuel industries' legitimation strategies, we
   analyze the coal industry's campaign to remove mining limits that were
   established after the country's democratic transition in 1991. Data come
   from interviews and document analysis. While extant research has
   established how elites can reinforce their legitimacy, our research
   provides insight into the specific mechanisms deployed to diffuse
   potential legitimacy crises. Specifically, we found that elites utilized
   four mechanisms: amplification, vilification, pacification, and
   fearmongering. We conclude by providing a roadmap for future research
   analyzing elite strategies to defend actions that exacerbate climate
   change.},

Title = {Does unionization reduce CO2 emissions in Canada?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The existing literature is ambivalent on the relationship between
   unionization and climate change. There is some anecdotal evidence that
   in some cases, labor unions play a role in implementing climate
   protection measures. In other cases, unions were more concerned with
   saving jobs than with reducing emissions. Nonetheless, empirical studies
   on the relationship between unions and environmental outcomes are
   limited. The objective of this study is to fill the gap in the
   literature by examining if unionization has any impact on CO2 emissions
   in Canada, after controlling for energy consumption, unemployment rate,
   and real GDP per capita. Cointegration techniques including Johansen
   methods and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) techniques are applied
   to a dataset that covers the period from 1969 to 2016. The results
   suggest that, on average, a 1\% increase in unionization reduces CO2
   emissions by approximately 0.25\%. This is the first study that examines
   the union-climate dynamics for Canada. One policy implication of the
   finding is that the governments should develop incentives for industries
   to implement climate measures through collective bargaining.},

Volume = {190},
Number = {SI},

Abstract = {Since the early days of the Journal of Controlled Release, there has
   been considerable interest in materials that can release drug on an
   ``on-demand{''} basis. So called ``stimuli-responsive{''} and
   ``intelligent{''} systems have been designed to deliver drug at various
   times or at various sites in the body, according to a stimulus that is
   either endogenous or externally applied. In the past three decades,
   research along these lines has taken numerous directions, and each new
   generation of investigators has discovered new physicochemical
   principles and chemical schemes by which the release properties of
   materials can be altered. No single review could possibly do justice to
   all of these approaches. In this article, some general observations are
   made, and a partial history of the field is presented. Both open loop
   and closed loop systems are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on
   stimuli-responsive hydrogels, and on systems that can respond
   repeatedly. It is argued that the most success at present and in the
   foreseeable future is with systems in which biosensing and actuation
   (i.e. drug delivery) are separated, with a human and/or cybernetic
   operator linking the two. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MITOCHONDRION},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The mitochondria are defined by their unique structure and cellular
   functions which includes energy production, metabolic regulation,
   apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell motility and
   transport as well as free radical generation. Recent advances geared
   towards enhancing the diagnostic and prognostic value of cancer patients
   have targeted the circulating mitochondria genome due to its specific
   and unique characteristics. Circulating mitochondria DNA is known to
   possess short length, relatively simple molecular structure and a high
   copy number. These coupled with its ability to serve as a liquid biopsy
   makes it an easily accessible non-invasive biomarker for diagnostics and
   prognostics of various forms of solid tumors. In this article, we review
   recent findings on circulating mitochondria DNA content in cancer. In
   addition, we provide an insight into the potential of circulating
   mitochondria DNA to act as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker and its
   linearity with clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.},

Title = {Do Changes in TASER Use Policy Affect Police Officer Injury Rates?},
Journal = {POLICE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {410-434},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The addition of TASERs as a less lethal use-of-force option for police
   officers has facilitated much discussion in recent scholarship. Many
   police agencies have responded with force policy changes specific to
   appropriate applications for these weapons. While the goal of these
   changes is often to minimize concern about injury to citizens, debate
   rests on whether injury rates for officers are influenced by such
   transitions in policy. The present study used officer injury panel data
   from the City of Dallas (Texas) Human Resources Department to assess the
   impact of a 2005 modification to the Dallas Police Department's TASER
   policy. The goal of the study was to assess change in the rate of
   officer injury after the implementation of a more restrictive policy. We
   observed a modest increase in the monthly rate of police officer
   injuries following the policy restricting use. These results were found
   net of other effects, with some noteworthy between-patrol-division
   variation. Implications for TASER use policy and future research are
   discussed within.},

Title = {Prime-time access for whom? Rhythms fairness and the dynamic pricing of
   infrastructure services},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Abstract = {In this paper, we approach a fair and inclusive transition to a circular
   economy from a perspective of daily rhythms and illustrate these
   concepts using examples from the electricity and transport sectors. The
   circular economy discourse endorses sharing and efficiently using
   capital assets. To be effective, such strategies further need to manage
   the timing of demand. Dynamic pricing is frequently used to manage, for
   example, the demand for electricity services and to match demand with
   the capacity of production. Congestion charges for road usage similarly
   aim to shape peak demand. The economic and environmental benefits of
   these schemes have been demonstrated, but the social consequences remain
   underexplored. Dynamic prices forge new everyday rhythms and contribute
   to ``shift consumption{''} by limited access during peak demand. We
   inquire whether, and to what extent, the existing schemes of dynamic
   pricing consider issues of equality, equity and fairness when offering
   time-dependent and dynamic tariffs, and highlight the policy
   implications of promoting a circular economy with effective and more
   socially just management of the timing of demand.},

Title = {Comparing integrated stable isotope and eddy covariance estimates of
   water-use efficiency on a Mediterranean successional sequence},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {581-594},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Water-use efficiency (WUE), thought to be a relevant trait for
   productivity and adaptation to water-limited environments, was estimated
   for three different ecosystems on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa:
   Mediterranean macchia (S-MM), transition (S-TR) and abandoned
   agricultural (S-AA) ecosystems, representing a successional series.
   Three independent approaches were used to study WUE: eddy covariance
   measurements, C isotope composition of ecosystem respired CO2, and C
   isotope discrimination (Delta) of leaf material (dry matter and soluble
   sugars). Seasonal variations in C-water relations and energy fluxes,
   compared in S-MM and in S-AA, were primarily dependent on the specific
   composition of each plant community. WUE of gross primary productivity
   was higher in S-MM than in S-AA at the beginning of the dry season. Both
   structural and fast-turnover leaf material were, on average, more
   enriched in C-13 in S-MM than S-AA, indicating relatively higher
   stomatal control and WUE for the long-lived macchia species. This
   pattern corresponded to C-13-enriched respired CO2 in S-MM compared to
   the other ecosystems. Conversely, most of the annual herbaceous S-AA
   species (terophytes) showed a drought-escaping strategy, with relatively
   high stomatal conductance and low WUE. An ecosystem-integrated Delta
   value was weighted for each ecosystem on the abundance of different life
   forms, classified according to Raunkiar's system. Agreement was found
   between ecosystem WUE calculated using eddy covariance and those
   estimated using integrated Delta approaches. Comparing the isotopic
   methods, Delta of leaf soluble sugars provided the most reliable proxy
   for short-term changes in photosynthetic discrimination and associated
   shifts in integrated canopy-level WUE along the successional series.},

Abstract = {Notwithstanding the success of polymer-carbon nanotube (CNT)
   nanocomposites, a solid understanding of the impact of external
   perturbations, including temperature and stress, on the electrical
   response, its reproducibility, and the subsequent relationship to the
   topology of the percolative morphology and molecular details of the
   CNT-CNT contact junction is not complete. Using an in situ synthesis
   approach, two series of polymide (CP2)-carbon nanofiber (CNF) composites
   are prepared with quantitatively (small-angle X-ray scattering)
   comparable CNF dispersions, but differing in the structure of the
   CNF-polymer interface. Amino-functionalized CNFs (FCNFs) enable direct
   formation of CP2 grafts onto the CNFs, whereas pristine CNFs (PCNFs)
   result in a relatively weak interface between the carbon nanofiber and
   CP2 matrix. In general, low-frequency ac impedance measurements are well
   described by the percolation bond model, yielding a percolation
   threshold below 1 vol \% (0.24 and 0.68 vol \% for PCNF-CP2 and
   FCNF-CP2, respectively). However, the design of the interface is
   determined to be crucial for controlling the electrical behavior in four
   substantial ways: magnitude of the limiting conductivity, linearity of
   the I-V response, magnitude and direction of temperature-dependent
   resistivity, and reproducibility of the absolute value of the
   resistivity with thermal cycling. These observations are consistent with
   a direct CNF-CNF contact limiting transport in the PCNF-CP2 system,
   where the CP2 grafts onto the FCNF from a dielectric layer, limiting
   transport within the FCNF-CP2 system. Furthermore, the grafted CP2
   chains on the FCNF reduce local polymer dewetting at the CNF surfaces
   when the temperature exceeds the CP2 glass transition. This appears to
   stabilize the structure of the percolation network and associated
   conductivity. The general behavior of these interfacial extremes
   (pristine and fully functionalized CNFs) set important bounds on the
   design of interface modification for CNFs when the intended use is for
   electrical performance at elevated temperatures or under extreme current
   loads.},

Title = {Stranded assets and stranded resources: Implications for climate change
   mitigation and global sustainable development},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Paris Agreement's 2 degrees C objective requires that more than 80\%
   of all proven fossil fuel reserves become stranded resources, and
   investments in such resources may become stranded assets for
   industrialized and developing countries. The literature scarcely covers
   the implications of stranded assets and resources for `latecomers' to
   development. Hence, we address the question: What does a literature
   review of stranded resources and stranded assets in a diversity of
   fields imply for latecomers to development in the fields of climate
   change and global sustainable development? We find seven dimensions in
   the literature: (i) Spatial: where first comers use their own resources
   and resources of other countries for their own development leaving
   little environmental utilization space for latecomers to develop; (ii)
   Technological: when first comers `dump' older technologies (stranded
   assets) on latecomers; (iii) Economic: when first comers avoid paying
   compensation for damage caused to latecomers or for the stranding of
   resources in latecomer countries; and first comers may potentially also
   indirectly transfer their soon to be worthless shares on latecomers;
   (iv) Ecological: when knowledge from first comers may prevent latecomers
   from using their resources/ or may accelerate the rate at which their
   resources and assets become stranded; (v) Political: when first comers
   refuse to take environmental action claiming that latecomers are not
   doing so; while latecomers may claim that first comers should take
   action first; (vi) Legal/Policy: when investments in resources and
   assets in a globalizing world involve long-term contracts protected
   under private law may cause policy freezing and liabilities in
   latecomers; and (vii) Social: when latecomers adopt different notions on
   development than first comers. Latecomers need to be sensible in
   deciding which resources to develop to avoid carbon lock-in and whether
   phasing-in renewables could avoid creating stranded assets in the first
   place.},

Title = {Universality in fragment inclusive yields from Au plus Au collisions},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW C},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The inclusive light fragment (Z less than or equal to 7) yield data in
   Au+Au reactions, measured by the EOS Collaboration at the LBNL Bevalac,
   are presented as a function of multiplicity. Moving from central to
   peripheral collisions the measured charge distributions develop
   progressively according to a power law which can be fitted, within
   errors, by a single tau exponent independently of the bombarding energy
   except for the data at 250A MeV. In addition, the location of the
   maximum in the individual yields of different charged fragments, for a
   given beam energy, shifts towards lower multiplicity as the fragment
   charge increases from Z=3 to Z=7. This trend is common to ail six
   measured beam energies. Moments of charge distribution are also
   reported. The universal features observed in the present Au + Au data
   are consistent with previous experimental findings in the Au + C
   multifragmentation reaction at 1A GeV.},

Title = {Smallholder telecoupling and potential sustainability},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Smallholders are crucial for global sustainability given their
   importance to food and nutritional security, agriculture, and
   biodiversity conservation. Worldwide smallholders are subject to
   expanded telecoupling whereby their social-ecological systems are linked
   to large-scale socioeconomic and environmental drivers. The present
   research uses the synthesis of empirical evidence to demonstrate
   smallholder telecoupling through the linkages stemming from the
   global-level integration of markets (commodity, labor, finance),
   urbanization, governance, and technology. These telecoupling forces are
   often disadvantageous to smallholders while certain conditions can
   contribute to the potential sustainability of their social-ecological
   systems. Case studies were chosen to describe sustainability
   opportunities and limits involving smallholder production and
   consumption of high-agrobiodiversity Andean maize amid telecoupled
   migration (Bolivia), the role of international eco-certification in
   smallholder coffee-growing and agroforests (Colombia), smallholder
   organic dairy production in large-scale markets and technology transfer
   (upper Midwest, U.S.A.), and smallholders' global niche commodity
   production of argan oil (Morocco). These case studies are used to
   identify the key challenges and opportunities faced by smallholders in
   telecoupling and to develop a conceptual framework. This framework
   specifies the integrated roles of global systems together with
   influential public and private institutions operating at multiple scales
   including the national level. The framework also integrates the local
   dynamics of smallholders' multiple land use units and their
   socioeconomic and environmental variation. Spatial spillover effects in
   smallholder landscapes are an additional element. This framework further
   establishes the un-Romantic, nonteleological, and antifetishistic view
   of smallholders. It provides specific insights on the multilevel
   dynamics of smallholder telecoupling and potential sustainability
   opportunities that can strengthen livelihoods, biodiversity
   conservation, and food and nutritional security. These insights are
   concluded to be valuable to environmental, agricultural, and food
   scientists and scholars (both biogeophysical sciences and social
   sciences), policy makers, institutional analysts, development
   specialists and practitioners, social justice activists, and others
   seeking to advance global sustainability including sustainable
   development.},

Abstract = {Multifragmentation in fully reconstructed events from 1A GeV Kr and La
   collisions with C has been studied. Results are compared with similar
   data for 1A GeV Au+C. The emitted charged particles and fragments are
   identified with emission from either a prompt first stage or a second
   stage in which the remnant resulting from the first stage breaks up. The
   nuclear charge, mass, and excitation energy distributions of the remnant
   are determined. The total charged multiplicity, as well as those of the
   first and second stages are obtained. Freeze-out temperatures and
   thermal excitation energy permit the determination of the caloric curve.
   The fragment charge distribution as well as the IMF multiplicity
   distribution and those of individual Fragments are obtained. The various
   results are examined as to the extent of universal behavior when scaled
   for varying system size. Comparisons are made with intranuclear cascade
   and statistical multifragmentation model calculations.},

Abstract = {It is shown that thermodynamic scaling when applied to systems with few
   (similar to 150) constituents, in accordance with the theory of critical
   phenomena, is observed in nuclear multifragmentation. Yields of
   different nuclear fragments, obtained over a wide range of excitation
   energies, collapse with some scatter onto a universal curve. This curve
   is the nuclear scaling function, which is intimately related to the free
   energy of the system. The determination of the scaling function forms
   the basis for quantitatively predicting the critical behavior in nuclei.

Abstract = {Using the large acceptance Time Projection Chamber of experiment E895 at
   Brookhaven, measurements of collective sideward flow in Au + Au
   collisions at beam energies of 2A, 4A, 6A, and 8A GeV are presented in
   the form of in-plane transverse momentum {[}p(x)] and the first Fourier
   coefficient of azimuthal anisotropy vl. These measurements indicate a
   smooth variation of sideward now as a function of beam energy. The data
   are compared with four nuclear transport models which have an
   orientation towards this energy range. All four exhibit some qualitative
   trends similar to those found in the data, although none show a
   consistent pattern of agreement within experimental uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Three new NOS donor ligands have been prepared by addition ethanolic
   suspension of 2-hydrazino-2-oxo-N-phenyl-acetamide to phenyl isocyanate
   (H(2)PAPS), phenyl isothiocyanate (H(2)PAPT) and benzoyl isothiocyanate
   (H(2)PABT). The Ni(II) complexes prepared from the chloride salt and
   characterized by conventional techniques. The isolated complexes were
   assigned the formulaes, {[}Ni-2(PAPS)(H2O)(2)](H2O)(2),
   {[}Ni(H-2-PAPT)Cl-2(H2O)](H2O)(2) and {[}(Ni)(2)(HPABT)(2)Cl-2(H2O)(2)],
   respectively. The IR spectra of complexes shows that H(2)PAPS behaves as
   a binegative pentadentate via both CO of hydrazide moiety in keto and
   enol form, enolized CO of cyanate moiety and the CN (azomethine) groups
   of enolization. H(2)PAPT behaves as neutral tridentate via both CO of
   hydrazide moiety and CN (azomethine) group due to SH formation and
   finally H(2)PABT behaves as mononegative tetradentate via CO and
   enolized CO of hydrazide moiety, CO of benzoyl moiety and C=S groups.
   The experimental IR spectra of ligands are compared with those obtained
   theoretically from DFT calculations. Also, the bond lengths, bond
   angles, HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals), WMO (Lowest
   Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) and dipole moments have been calculated.
   The calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap reveals that charge transfer occurs
   within the molecule. The theoretical values of binding energies indicate
   the higher stability of complexes than of ligands. Also, the kinetic and
   thermodynamic parameters for the different thermal degradation steps of
   the complexes were determined by Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger
   methods. The antibacterial activities were also tested against B.
   Subtilis and E. coli bacteria. The free ligands showed a higher
   antibacterial effect than their Ni(II) complexes. The antitumor
   activities of the Ligands and their Ni(II) complexes have been evaluated
   against liver (HePG2) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. All ligands were
   found to display cytotoxicity that are better than that of Fluorouracil
   (5-FU), while Ni(II) complexes show low activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Structural Features of China's Industrial Pollution Inequality: A
   Spatial-Temporal Distribution Perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {With growing concerns about the allocation inequality of environmental
   benefits and pollution, it is crucial to investigate whether a special
   characteristic of China's environmental inequality has emerged. The
   present study aims to elucidate the regional spatial features of
   industrial pollution inequality (IPI) (waste gas, wastewater, and solid
   waste measured by the Theil index separately) and their relevance to
   national territorial space planning strategies. Furthermore, we make a
   novel attempt to develop an integrated framework that employs a
   developed-Kaya identity with the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method
   to uncover the driving force of IPI disparities. We make use of the data
   published recently by the provincial panel of China, during the period
   2000-2015. Based on this information, we found notable spatial-temporal
   heterogeneity in China's IPI, highly correlated to China's core national
   territorial space planning strategy, the ``T-shaped{''} spatial
   development strategy. The empirical results support the ``structural
   features{''} hypothesis in IPI for China. In particular, the Coastal
   Region has a great edge in industrial pollution equality. In most
   provinces in the Inland Corridor along the Yangtze River, the trend of
   IPI has been alleviated to some extent. However, provinces further
   inland that are off-side the two axes of ``T-shaped{''} spatial
   development strategy have to respond to the two-fold challenge of the
   exacerbated trend in IPI both within and between the regions. Our
   findings also indicate that the effect of technological inequality is
   the main driving force for IPI in the earlier stage of development.
   However, effects of economic inequality together with that of economic
   structure inequality manifest in the middle or transition period and the
   economic inequality effect is the determinant in the later stage of
   development. Additionally, contributions of size effect and inequality
   effect are changeable over development process, economic inequality
   effect outweighs the economic size effect for IPI in more developed
   districts or districts in higher developing phases. These findings may
   help the government incorporate environmental equality goals into
   regional policies and contribute to the emerging literature on
   environmental inequality.},

Title = {Divestment trends in Japan's international coal businesses},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Continued investments in coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) and coal mining
   are incompatible with the Paris Agreement. As a major investor of both
   upstream coal mining and downstream CFPP construction, Japanese firms
   play a large role in sustaining the international coal market. Yet since
   mid-2018 numerous Japanese companies have announced a range of coal
   divestment policies. This situation, however, has not been unexamined by
   scholarship. Additionally, divestment literature outside Japan has
   focused overwhelmingly on financial institutions rather than the roles
   of other industry players driving the coal market. To address this gap,
   this paper examines four industries comprising Japan's international
   coal market (trading companies, electric utilities, plant equipment
   manufacturers and financial institutions) to empirically assess the
   extent of divestment behaviour and identify drivers and barriers. The
   empirical data reveal a slowdown, but not a cessation, of new and
   existing coal-related investments. Results also show that the extent of
   divestment trends can be largely explained by commercial factors,
   although institutional and structural factors are also at play. These
   findings have important policy implications.},

Abstract = {One NO and two NOS donor ligands have been prepared by addition
   ethanolic suspension of 2-hydrazino-2-oxo-N-phenyl-acetamide to phenyl
   isocyanate (H(2)PAPS), phenyl isothiocyanate (H(2)PAPT) and benzoyl
   isothiocyanate (H(2)PABT). The Mn (II) complexes were prepared from the
   chloride salt and characterized by conventional techniques. The isolated
   complexes were assigned the formulaes, {[}Mn(HPAPS)(2)], {[}Mn(HPAPT)Cl]
   and {[}Mn(HPABT)Cl(H2O)(2)], respectively. The IR study of ligands and
   their complexes shows that H(2)PAPS behaves as a mononegative tridentate
   via both CO of hydrazide moiety in keto and deprotonated enol form and
   CN (azomethine) due to enolization of CO cyanate moiety without
   deprotonation. H(2)PAPT behaves as mononegative tridentate via CO of
   hydrazide moiety, deprotonated thiol CS and NH group. Finally H(2)PABT
   behaves as mononegative tridentate via deprotonated enolized CO of
   hydrazide moiety, CO of benzoyl moiety and NH group. The IR spectra of
   ligands from DFT calculations are compared with those obtained
   experimentally. Also, HOMO, LUMO, the bond lengths, bond angles, and
   dipole moments have been calculated. The calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap
   reveals that charge transfer occurs within the molecule. The binding
   energy values display the high stability of complexes. The kinetic and
   thermodynamic parameters were determined by Coats-Redfern and
   Horowitz-Metzger methods. The antibacterial activities were also tested
   against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli bacteria. Finally, the
   antitumor activities of the Ligands and their Mn(II) complexes have been
   evaluated against liver (HePG2) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. (C)

Abstract = {In the present work on coordinating chemistry, new Cu(II) complexes have
   been synthesized from the regular reflux and ball mining methods using
   Schiff base prepared via condensation of
   2-hydrazino-2-oxo-N-phenylacetamide with 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde. All
   of the synthesized compounds were analyzed by various techniques, such
   as magnetic-moment measuring techniques, FT-IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR, UV/Vis
   spectroscopy and TGA. Field emission scanning electron spectroscopy
   (FE-SEM) and EDX were using for determination of size and morphology of
   the nano metal complexes. Molar conductance studies have confirmed the
   non-electrolytic nature of the metal complexes. The obtained FT-IR data
   supports the binding of Cu ion to Schiff base. Different mode of
   cleation and ratio of ligand towards Cu(II) by change method of
   preparation. The geometry of free ligand has been optimized at the same
   level of DFT calculations as the complexes studied in order to compare
   their data with that of the complexed ligand. The optimization results
   in addition to spectroscopic and magnetic measurements show that the
   Cu(II) center is square planner for the {[}Cu(L)Cl] while octahedral for
   {[}CuH2LCl2(H2O)(2)] complexes. Mulliken charges determine the
   distributions of charges on donor and acceptor atoms. The charge
   distribution shows that during complex formation the ligands transfer
   their negative charges to Cu(II) ions. In the gas phase, the electronic
   excitation energies of Cu(II)complexes are measured using time-dependent
   functional density theory (TD-DFT). There is a decrease in (Eg) values
   after complexation with Cu(II), indicating that (Eg) increase upon
   complexation with metal ions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Structural, spectral analysis and DNA studies of heterocyclic

Abstract = {The paper presents a combined experimental and computational study of
   novel Cr(III), Fe(III), Co(II), Hg(II) and U(VI) complexes of
   (E)-2-((3-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)methylene)-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydrazinecar
   bothioamide (H2L). The ligand and its complexes have been characterized
   by elemental analyses, spectral (IR, UV-vis, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR),
   magnetic and thermal studies. IR spectra show that H2L is coordinated to
   the metal ions in a mononegative bi or tri manner. The structures are
   suggested to be octahedral for all complexes except Hg(II) complex is
   tetrahedral. Theoretical calculations have been performed to obtain IR
   spectra of ligand and its complexes using AM1, MM, Zindo/1, MM+ and PM3,
   methods. Satisfactory theoretical-experimental agreements were achieved
   by MM method for the ligand and PM3 for its complexes. DOS calculations
   carried out by MM (ADF) method for ligand Hg complex from which we
   concluded that the thiol form of the ligand is more active than thione
   form and this explains that the most complexation take place in that
   form. The calculated IR vibrations of the metal complexes, using the PM3
   method was the nearest method for the experimental data, and it could be
   used for all complexes. Also, valuable information are obtained from
   calculation of molecular parameters for all compounds carried out by the
   previous methods of calculation (electronegativity of the coordination
   sites, net dipole moment of the metal complexes, values of heat of
   formation and binding energy) which approved that the complexes are more
   stable than ligand. The low value of Delta E could be expected to
   indicate H2L molecule has high inclination to bind with the metal ions.
   Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the different
   decomposition steps were calculated using the Coats-Redfern and
   Horowitz-Metzger methods. Finally, the biochemical studies showed that,
   complex 2, 4 have powerful and complete degradation effect on DNA. For
   the foremost majority of cases the activity of the ligand is greatly
   enhanced by the presence of a metal ion. Thus presented results may be
   useful in design new more active or specific structures. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Synthesis of complexes derived from hydrazones derived from both

   coordinated as mononegative tridentate with both Mn(II) and Co(II). The
   electronic spectra of the complexes as well as their magnetic moments
   suggested octahedral geometries for all the isolated complexes. The

Title = {Equity, technological innovation and sustainable behaviour in a

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The world must ambitiously curtail greenhouse gas emissions to achieve
   climate stability. The literature often supposes that a low-carbon
   future will depend on a mix of technological innovation-improving the
   performance of new technologies and systems-as well as more sustainable
   behaviours such as travelling less or reducing waste. To what extent are
   low-carbon technologies, and their associated behaviours, currently
   equitable, and what are potential policy and research implications
   moving forward? In this Review, we examine how four innovations in
   technology and behaviour-improved cookstoves and heating, battery
   electric vehicles, household solar panels and food-sharing-create
   complications and force trade-offs on different equity dimensions. We
   draw from these cases to discuss a typology of inequity cutting across
   demographic (for example, gender, race and class), spatial (for example,
   urban and rural divides), interspecies (for example, human and
   non-human) and temporal (for example, future generations)
   vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the risk of inequity abounds in
   decarbonization pathways. Moreover, low-carbon innovations are not
   automatically just, equitable or even green. We show how such
   technologies and behaviours can both introduce new inequalities and
   reaffirm existing ones. We then discuss potential policy insights and
   leverage points to make future interventions more equitable and propose
   an integrated research agenda to supplement these policy efforts.
   Low-carbon innovations in technology and behaviour are increasingly
   prevalent, but they are not always equitable. This Review examines how
   such innovations can introduce and perpetrate inequalities, and
   discusses ways to ensure that a low-carbon future is both sustainable
   and equitable.},

Abstract = {We engineered a machine learning approach, MSHub, to enable
   auto-deconvolution of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data.
   We then designed workflows to enable the community to store, process,
   share, annotate, compare and perform molecular networking of GC-MS data
   within the Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking
   analysis platform. MSHub/GNPS performs auto-deconvolution of compound
   fragmentation patterns via unsupervised non-negative matrix
   factorization and quantifies the reproducibility of fragmentation
   patterns across samples.
   A machine learning workflow enables auto-deconvolution of gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry data.},
